In SAP R/3 Financial Accounting, it serves as a subsidiary ledger to the FI General Ledger, providing detailed information on transactions involving fixed assets. Implementation Considerations The R/3 Asset Accounting component is intended for international use in many countries, irrespective of the nature of the industry. This means, for example, that no country-specific valuation rules are hard-coded in the system. You give this component its country-specific and company-specific character with the settings you make in Customizing. To minimize the time and energy involved in Customizing, country-specific defaults are provided in the standard system where possible. The Implementation Guide (IMG) provides the necessary functions for this in Asset Accounting. Integration As a result of the integration in the R/3 System, Asset Accounting (FI-AA) transfers data directly to and from other R/3 components. For example, it is possible to post from the Materials Management (MM) component directly to FI-AA. When an asset is purchased or produced in- house, you can directly post the invoice receipt or goods receipt, or the withdrawal from the warehouse, to assets in the Asset Accounting",

The Treasury (TR) component offers special functions for managing financial assets 14 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Organizational Elements and Structures Organizational Elements and Structures Purpose In addition to providing for the management of assets and their values, asset accounting should offer an organizational structure for assets that reflects the organizational structure of the enterprise. For this reason, the Asset Accounting (FI-AA) component uses the various SAP organizational units. An asset is clearly assigned to these organizational units at any given point in time. In addition, you need to classify assets according to various accounting criteria (such as depreciation methods). This classification assists in management-accounting-oriented tasks, and in the summarization of asset values in the general ledger. April 2001 15 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Organizational Elements and Structures Chart of Depreciation Definition Charts of depreciation are used in order to manage various legal requirements for the depreciation and valuation of assets. These charts of depreciation are usually country-specific and are defined independently of the other organizational units.

Structure The chart of depreciation consists of the following parts: • In general, you are required to calculate values for assets for different needs, both internal and external (such as book depreciation and cost depreciation). Therefore, the Asset Accounting component enables you to manage values for assets in parallel in up to 99 depreciation areas. The chart of depreciation, therefore, is a directory of depreciation areas organized according to business management requirements. You define the characteristics, and thereby the significance, of the individual depreciation areas in each chart of depreciation. A depreciation area is always assigned to only one chart of depreciation. • You flexibly define the keys for the automatic depreciation of assets in each chart of depreciation. They are based on elements for calculation (calculation methods, period controls, and so on) that are available client-wide. 16 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Organizational Elements and Structures You can change and add to the standard calculation keys that are delivered with the system (refer to Depreciation [Page 123] ) • There are specific objects in the chart of depreciation for special calculations of asset values (for example, investment support keys for investment support - refer",

Use SAP supplies typical reference charts of depreciation for each country. They have different depreciation areas and depreciation keys depending on that country’s specific requirements. You cannot use these charts of depreciation directly. You must create your own chart of depreciation by copying the reference chart of depreciation. Delete any depreciation areas that are not needed.

In addition to a plant, you can make a time- dependent assignment of the asset to a location. Address In the Customizing definition of the location, you can also specify an address. Using this method, you can indirectly assign an address to an asset. The comprehensive address data consists mainly of • Street address • PO box • Information for communication (such as telephone number) Since the address is linked to the location, all assets with the same location must have the same address. You can obtain reports related to the address using a standard report in the FI-AA Information System (refer to Asset Lists [Page 287]).

The history of the cost center changes can be managed in the system as long as you wish. A cost center can also be assigned to a business area as an asset can. In asset master record maintenance, therefore, the system ensures that the business area of the cost center matches the business area of the asset. Assets can be assigned to profit centers indirectly, by means of the cost center. In this way, account assignment to profit center is possible for asset business transactions that affect net income. For more information, see the documentation for the R/3 Profit Center Accounting (EC- PCA) component. Special rules apply to changes to cost center assignment, if this change affects the profit center assignment of the asset. When this is the case, certain preconditions have to be met. For more information, refer to Changes to Master Data [Page 365] If you assign assets to more than one cost center at the same time, you have to do one of the following: • Distribute the costs within cost accounting using a distribution cost center. • Post depreciation and interest to an internal order and then settle the order.

Cross-company code cost accounting allows you to assign a cost center to an asset when the company code of the cost center is not the same as that of the asset. Before you do this, you have to allow this procedure in Customizing (under Master Data). The system then makes additional account assignment of depreciation and interest to this cost center (that is in a different company code than the asset). The system posts the debits using the cost element that is entered as depreciation expense account in the FI-AA account determination. This type of posting is possible since all of the company codes belonging to a controlling area have to use the same chart of accounts. The rest of the posting procedure depends on whether the account assignment to cost center takes place in the book depreciation area or in the cost-accounting area: • If the account assignment to cost center is in the book depreciation area, the system posts the depreciation expense in the company code of the cost center, and the value adjustments in the company code of the asset.

It contains information for the valuation of the asset, as well as organizational information. • Below the asset main number, the asset can be further divided into its component parts by the use of asset sub-numbers. You can use sub-numbers to depreciate subsequent acquisitions to an asset separately from the original asset. • The lowest level consists of the transaction data per depreciation area (such as acquisitions or retirements) that belong to the asset master record (line items).

To generate asset classes that correspond to your G/L accounts, choose Organizational Structures → Asset Classes → Generate Asset Classes from G/L Accounts in Customizing for Asset Accounting. Features Depending on the functions you want the asset class to have, consider the following when creating asset classes: • The asset class provides default values to all asset master records in the class. In this way, the asset class functions as a sample master record, and makes it possible to create new asset master records simply and without errors. • The screen layout, tab layout and the field characteristics (required/optional/suppressed) of the asset master record can be set for the asset class. • The assignment of asset numbers can be controlled by the asset class. • The asset class is a selection criteria in all standard reports in Asset Accounting. In addition, you can also request sorting and totaling by class-specific characteristics. It is particularly useful to use the asset class to provide default values for valuation parameters (depreciation key, and so on). Therefore, define at least as many asset classes as you have assets with different valuation parameters.

Default Values You should create reasonable default values in the asset class for control and valuation parameters in the asset master record. The most important fields of the asset master record are also found in the asset class (general master data as well as valuation data). You can define the screen layout control, so that these fields can no longer be changed at the master record level (refer to Screen Layout and Maintenance Level [Page 214]). You need to enter defaults for administrative details (such as insurance information) only once for each asset class, and therefore uniformly for all company codes and charts of depreciation.

Account determination is the most important function of the asset class. There is a function in the system, therefore, for generating an asset class to correspond to each APC general ledger account. The system generates these asset classes automatically, in a one-to-one relationship to the accounts (see Prerequisites above). Note that several asset classes can use the same account determination key. Therefore, you can copy the asset classes that were generated by the system. The asset class, as a result, can provide a more detailed classification of assets than the asset G/L accounts. You need to assign the asset class key yourself for asset classes that you copy.

Features Deactivation of a Depreciation Area When you maintain an asset class, the system displays every depreciation area of the specified chart of depreciation. By deactivating depreciation areas, you can limit the management of asset values to the depreciation areas you need in your enterprise. For example, you can deactivate the depreciation areas in a particular asset class that deal with investment support measures, if they are irrelevant for the assets in this class. Once you have created asset master records for an asset class, you should not deactivate depreciation areas.

Due to the above restriction, it is not recommended that you manage a large number (or all) assets under construction on one master record. Instead, you should use a general ledger clearing account to temporarily collect acquisitions for assets under construction. Depreciation Ordinary depreciation is not allowed for assets under construction in most countries. You reflect this limitation by choosing a depreciation key that does not allow ordinary depreciation in the book depreciation area. To ensure that this depreciation key is protected during master data maintenance, select the asset class as the maintenance level for the book depreciation area (see Screen Layout and Maintenance Level [Page 214]).For certain assets under construction, special tax depreciation is allowed. In this case you also enter corresponding keys in the asset class, to be used as mandatory default values. Down Payments For posting down payments, allow the posting of the transaction type group \"Down payments\" (transaction type groups 15 and 16) in these asset classes. In addition, enter the necessary general ledger account in the account allocation. Also set the indicator for negative APC in the depreciation areas of the assets under construction.

The system activates this line item management when you create the asset, if the indicator for it is set in the asset class to which the asset belongs. This indicator also determines that the transaction type for down payments is automatically allowed in these classes. Settlement Profile You can define profiles for the line item settlement of assets in FI-AA Customizing. The profiles determine the receivers to which you are allowed to settle. In order to settle an asset under construction, an appropriate settlement profile must be entered in FI-AA Customizing per asset company code (Specify settlement profile). List Versions The transaction for the line item settlement of assets under construction enables you to select line items for allocation to a distribution rule group for each asset. You define display variants for these transactions in FI-AA Customizing (List versions).

April 2001 41 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Low-Value Assets (LVA) Low-Value Assets (LVA) Use In general, LVAs are fully depreciated in the year of purchase or in the period of acquisition. This can be achieved by using the special depreciation key GWG and the expected useful life of 1 month (period). In order to ensure that depreciation is fully posted in the acquisition month during the monthly depreciation posting, activate the catch-up method for the depreciation posting run (see System Settings for Depreciation Posting [Page 118]). Features In contrast to fixed assets of greater value, low value assets (LVAs) are completely depreciated in the year in which they are acquired. Therefore, you do not usually need an individual assessment of their values. Since they individually have little value, they are often managed collectively as a single asset master record. In the FI-AA component, you can collectively manage all the LVAs in a certain category (such as belonging to a given cost center) in this way. You activate collective management by entering a unit of quantity in the asset master record (see Quantity Management [Page 235]). Maximum Amount You set the maximum amount for low value assets when defining the depreciation area at company code level (Customizing: Transactions → Acquisitions). You can enter one maximum amount for purchase orders (taking possible discounts into account) and one for the actual acquisition posting.

When you make your first posting, you must also post the quantity. Simulation in the Asset History Sheet When you create an asset history sheet, you can specify that asset retirement be simulated for any low value assets acquired during a specified time period. The affected assets then appear in the asset history sheet as retired. The system ignores any actual retirements of low value assets when it calls up the asset history sheet. You should be aware that choosing to simulate LVA retirement in the asset history sheet means that you are required to do the same in following years. Otherwise, the danger exists that LVA retirements could be listed in two asset history sheets (once as simulated retirement, and once as actual retirement). Before running the report, enter the classes for low value assets, as well as the time period for the simulation.

The system simulates a complete retirement at the end of the fiscal year, if the book value of the asset is zero at that point in time (usually the case for low value assets). In addition, the retirement affects not only the fiscal year requested in the report, but also the previous fiscal year. There is a certain principle of continuity: if the asset already fulfilled the requirements for retirement simulation at the end of the previous year, then the system bases its simulation on a simulated retirement at the end of the previous year. There are two possible consequences: • The asset did not have any additional transactions in the current fiscal year. Then the system treats the asset as if it were retired in the previous year. The asset then no longer appears in the list. • There were additional transactions for the asset in the current fiscal year. In this case, the system treats the asset as if the entire acquisition value were retired at the end of the previous fiscal year. However, the system does not deactivate the asset.

However, in certain countries, you are nonetheless required to capitalize leased assets, depending on the type of financing. Features Valuation Methods for Leased Assets The result is that there are two different methods for handling the bookkeeping for leased assets, depending on legal requirements and the conditions of the lease. You must capitalize and depreciate certain leased assets (capital lease). Others are handled as periodic rent expense, and flow into the Profit and Loss statement (operating lease). See Leased Assets [Page 196] Master Data To use these methods, you must enter all the essential leasing contract information in the asset master record.

For complex assets, for example, there is often a need for uniform depreciation of the entire asset in the book depreciation and tax depreciation areas, whereas for cost accounting purposes, the sub-assets should be depreciated separately. Features Therefore, you can manage asset components in the system as sub-numbers. There are several reasons for managing component assets as sub-numbers: • The development of values for component assets is separate for each sub-number. • The sub-numbers can have different cost accounting assignments (for example, to different cost centers). • The asset can be divided along technical lines (for example, links to equipment in Plant Maintenance) • Investment support can be represented as negative sub-numbers. • If it is necessary to manage subsequent acquisitions separately in order to be able to monitor their depreciation and book values separately, you must manage these acquisitions on independent sub-numbers.

In order to monitor the value development of subsequent acquisitions to sub-assets (for example, upgrading or replacement acquisitions) separately according to years of acquisition, it is recommended that you use the following system for sub-number assignment.

You also specify in the screen layout control that uniform depreciation be carried out for all sub-numbers belonging to a main number. This specification will ensure that the evaluation and depreciation of all sub-numbers is identical, and that depreciation is calculated using the identical depreciation terms. To carry out changes to asset master data that are uniform for all sub-numbers, enter an asterisk (*) in the sub-number field in the initial screen of the change transaction. The system then carries out the changes that were made at the main number level for all sub-numbers. Reports In the display transactions and in reports, you can display asset values either individually by sub- number, or collectively. For displaying the asset values, you can also enter an asterisk (*) in the sub-number field in order to obtain totals for all sub-numbers.

The structure of this master record corresponds to the structure of the normal asset master record. You can determine the structure of this master record using screen layout control, just as you do for normal master records. Just the same as a normal asset, a group asset can have any number of sub-numbers. In this way it is possible, for example, to collect all the acquisitions for one year in a single sub-number master record at the level of the group asset. There is a separate master data transaction for creating group assets (Asset → Create → Group asset). This transaction corresponds to the transaction for creating normal assets.

You mark them using an indicator in the company code specific specifications for the depreciation area (FI-AA Customizing: Specify depreciation areas for group assets). Group assets have to be assigned to an asset class, just as normal assets do. You use an indicator in the asset class to specify that the class can be used only for group assets. Assignment of an Asset to a Group Asset You can assign an asset to a group asset by specific depreciation areas. For this purpose, there is a special field in the asset master record (in the detail display of each depreciation area). You enter the number of the group asset in this field. Once this entry is made, the system calculates and posts the depreciation for this depreciation area only at the level of the group asset. In this way, you can also assign one asset to different group assets in different depreciation areas. Graphic: Assignment to Group Asset by Depreciation Area [Page 57] Only assets that have the same positive/negative sign for their net book value can be assigned to the same group asset (that is, either all of the assets in the group have positive net book value, or all of the assets in the group have negative book value).

It is not possible to have assets with negative net book value and assets with positive net book value belonging to the same group asset. Substitution You can use substitution to assist in making the assignment to group assets, just as you can use substitution for other master data fields (see Validation and Substitution [Page 226]). This method makes it possible to automate the assignment to a group asset. For example, you can have the assignment be a default based on the asset class or on specific evaluation groups. Checks and Results of Assignment An assignment to a group asset is only possible as long as the asset is not capitalized (the asset is inactive). Once an assignment has been made and the asset is capitalized, you can only change the assignment by a complete transfer of the asset to a new asset. Another result of the assignment to a group asset is that the depreciation terms in assigned depreciation areas can no longer be changed at the asset level. They can only be changed at the level of the group asset. When you assign an asset to a group asset, the system checks if the asset has, at the minimum, all the depreciation areas that the group asset has. If it does not, the assignment is rejected. As a result of the assignment, the asset adopts the account allocation of the group asset. This method ensures that all the assets in a group asset post to the same general ledger",

Legacy Data Transfer When you transfer legacy asset data, normal assets and group assets have to be transferred separately. The group asset and the assignment to its asset master records are not created automatically. Therefore, there is no consistency check between the values of the group asset and the values of the individual assets. 54 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Group Assets Posting When you post to an asset belonging to a group asset, the system duplicates all the line items that are created (such as, acquisitions) on the group asset as well. This duplication takes place according to whether depreciation area is assigned to the group asset. Direct posting of transactions to a group asset is generally not possible. Graphic: Acquisition to a Group Asset [Page 58] You should note the following special considerations with the different transaction categories: • Acquisitions There are no special considerations here. The system posts acquisitions to the individual asset and duplicates the line items online to the group asset it belongs to. • Retirements Gain/loss from asset retirements and transfers requires special handling. You can make specifications for this in FI-AA Customizing for the retirement transaction types, per depreciation area (Determine treatment of asset retirement). – Retirement with gain/loss – Gain/loss handled on liabilities side – Gain handled on liabilities side For more information, see Posting Gain/Loss [Page 246].

The calculation is to some extent less exact because it can be based on overall figures. As a result, there can be small differences between individual assets and the group asset. • Transfers You can specify for intracompany transfers whether you want to transfer APC only, or also accumulated depreciation. You make this specification in the transaction type definition for each depreciation area. In this way, it is possible to transfer only APC (without depreciation) when making a transfer within a group asset. Transfers between assets from different group assets are only possible if the assets were acquired in the same fiscal year. In addition, the same restrictions apply to these transfers as to transfers between assets that do not belong to a group asset. When transferring acquisitions from prior years between group assets, make sure that you use a transaction type for the acquisition that allows the takeover of the historical depreciation start date (FI-AA Customizing: Indicator in the definition of the transaction type). • Write-ups/manual depreciation Write-ups and manual depreciation have to be posted directly to group assets, just as automatically calculated value adjustments do.

Depreciation areas are grouped together, according to the requirements of a specific country or economic area, into a chart of depreciation (refer to Chart of Depreciation [Page 16]). Features The depreciation areas are identified by two-digit numeric keys. You specify the asset-specific depreciation terms for every depreciation area belonging to the chart of depreciation. You enter the depreciation terms in the asset class or directly in the asset master record of the particular asset(see Asset Master Record [Page 209]). This makes it possible, for example, for you to use straight-line depreciation for your internal accounting purposes and use declining-balance depreciation for the balance sheet.

You can also post the values of the derived areas to Financial Accounting. Features You define the formula for the derived depreciation area in FI-AA Customizing (Define depreciation areas). In the formula for a derived area, you can use up to four real areas. The arithmetic operations allowed are addition and subtraction. It is possible to mix the calculation rules. This includes using proportional values from real areas in the calculation. When defining the formula, it is up to you to make sure it is reasonable. Make sure that the key of the derived area is larger than the keys of the real areas it is based on. A derived area \"03\" can be derived from the real areas \"01\" and \"02\"",

Features Posting Values from Depreciation Area to General Ledger You can automatically post asset balance sheet values (APC/ proportional value adjustments) and depreciation from each depreciation area to the corresponding general ledger accounts. You can choose whether values are automatically posted immediately online in Financial Accounting (at present, only possible for one area per chart of depreciation; with two exceptions: investment support areas managed on the liabilities side, and areas solely for revaluation), or are posted automatically at periodic intervals to Financial Accounting. In addition, you can specify that only depreciation (no APC values) should be posted automatically. This type of posting might be useful for depreciation areas for cost accounting depreciation.

Managing Certain Values In the definition of a depreciation area, you can specify if the area should manage acquisition and production costs (APC). Areas that do not manage APC are, for example, depreciation areas only for value adjustments shown on the liabilities side (for example, investment support). In addition, you specify in each depreciation area whether the net book value of assets in the area is allowed to be positive and/or negative. The system rejects any posting that leads to a net book value that contradicts the rule you entered. Allow negative net book value in all areas • That have depreciation below zero • That are intended for value adjustments shown on the liabilities side • That are derived depreciation areas, and can have negative values because of their calculation formula. Derived Depreciation Areas You enter a formula that defines the derived depreciation area (see Derived Depreciation Areas [Page 67]). Although you do not allow negative net book values in a derived depreciation area, negative values may occur due to the calculation formula. In this case the depreciation is reduced in the real areas (on which the derived area is based) until the net book value in the derived area is at least zero. For this reason it is recommended that you allow for both positive and negative net book value in derived depreciation areas. 70 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Features at Chart of Depreciation Level Takeover Between Depreciation Areas You can allow for depreciation areas to adopt APC, as well as depreciation terms, from another depreciation area.

Graphic: Takeover Rules [Page 73] Different Types of Depreciation/Special Values The type of value that a depreciation area manages is the most important factor in determining its significance. Therefore, you can decide for each depreciation area (under Depreciation or Special Valuation) whether it should manage the following value types: • Ordinary depreciation • Special tax depreciation • Unplanned depreciation • Transfer of reserves • Investment Support • Interest Please be aware that these specifications only allow the management of certain value types. Whether or not the system actually calculates these value types depends on additional parameters (such as, depreciation keys) or postings. Replacement Values/Revaluation You have to make the following specifications in depreciation areas that manage replacement values or revaluation: • Revaluation of APC (replacement values) • Revaluation of accumulated depreciation (backlog invoice) For more information, see Special Valuation [Page 167].

Features Amount Specifications You can make amount specifications for: memo value, the maximum amount for low value assets, the changeover value for declining balance depreciation, and rules for rounding off of APC and remaining book value (Valuation). When you carry out a partial retirement, the system automatically triggers depreciation recalculation. This procedure ensures that the remaining net book value is always rounded correctly (even if the proportional value adjustments of the retired APC amount would lead to a book value that is not rounded). Foreign Currencies The currency in the master depreciation area has to be identical to the local currency in the company code.

This area is required so that the special depreciation area 03 (which is a derived area) can calculate special reserves according to Paragraph 281(1) HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch = German Commercial Code [GCC]) or the amount differential according to Paragraph 285(5) HGB (GCC).

The asset control accounts for investment support on the liabilities side, on the other hand, have to be defined as reconciliation accounts (see Investment Support on the Liabilities Side [Page 180]). Valuation of Net Assets (10) In this depreciation area, you specify valuation rules for net worth tax. The area is needed if no other area covers the property valuation rules. Balance Sheet for Tax Purposes (15) This area is used for the management of values for an alternative balance sheet for tax purposes.

Consolidated Balance Sheet in Group Currency (31) This depreciation area is needed if a company belongs to a corporate group that reports in another currency. It is managed in the group currency. To clearly separate differences resulting from different valuation methods from differences due to currency conversion, the area \"consolidated balance sheet in local currency\" is also necessary in addition to this area.

For each investment support measure, you need to specify the liability accounts that will be posted. If you treat the support measure as a reduction of the APC on the assets side of the balance sheet, you do not necessarily need a separate depreciation area. You can deduct the investment support measure from the acquisition and production costs in any depreciation area. However, if you manage more than one investment support measure for a given asset, and you want to display the values separately, use a separate depreciation area for each additional support measure.

The depreciation periods in Asset Accounting then correspond to the posting periods in Financial Accounting. It is usually not necessary to create a separate fiscal year variant for Asset Accounting. Period Control The period control in the depreciation key determines the start and end of depreciation when asset transactions are posted (see Period Control [Page 147] ). The period control determines the relationship between the calendar period in which the asset transaction is posted and the depreciation period. These calendar periods are independent of the posting periods in Financial Accounting. The only restriction is that the beginning of the first calendar period and the end of the last calendar period defined in a period control have to match the start date and final date of the fiscal year in Financial Accounting.

April 2001 91 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Non-Calendar Fiscal Years Non-Calendar Fiscal Years Use If you choose to work with a non-calendar fiscal year, you need a General Ledger fiscal year variant with posting periods defined for it (FI-Customizing: Financial Accounting Global Settings). Assign this fiscal year version to the global company code parameters. Features Using a non-calendar fiscal year does not require special system settings in Asset Accounting. You make all date entries (such as the posting date) as normal calendar dates.

Special periods are not restricted, that is, your fiscal year variant can have as many special periods as you want. If the fiscal year variant is defined as year-dependent, you have to generate a new calendar assignment for depreciation period control each year (application menu: Periodic Processing → Settings ). Definition of Posting Periods (FI Customizing) The fiscal year variant contains the correlation between the calendar date and the posting periods. You assign a specific calendar time period to the various posting periods. You make this assignment by entering the last calendar date of each period.

This type of change might be necessary, for instance, if an enterprise becomes part of a new corporate group. Features The R/3 Financial Accounting component fully supports the use of shortened fiscal years. However, there are still some points to consider from the perspective of Asset Accounting when you use a shortened fiscal year. Timing of the Changeover You change the current fiscal year to a shortened fiscal year by changing the fiscal year version in the FI General Ledger. You can only make this change if there has not been any posting yet in a period that will disappear when the shortened fiscal year becomes effective. Reversing any such postings does not make the change possible.

Posting Periods In order for the calculation of depreciation to be correct in the shortened fiscal year, the shortened year must begin with period 1 and be defined with fewer posting periods. Therefore, when you change the fiscal year cycle, you must define the fiscal year version in the given company code as year-dependent. You can specially identify the shortened fiscal year and define fewer posting periods for it, only if the fiscal year version is year-dependent (FI Customizing: Financial Accounting global settings.) As long as you are still posting in or before the shortened fiscal year, or if you are transferring legacy data from this time period, then you must also retain the year-dependent fiscal year version, even after the shortened fiscal year. Define the fiscal year version with the full number of posting periods and the corresponding shift in the posting periods (see Non-Calendar Fiscal Years [Page 92]).

In order to predict depreciation, maintain the future years involved. For a version with a non-calendar fiscal year, the calendar/period assignments of the last maintained calendar year define only a part of the last fiscal year. Therefore, the system no longer predicts correct values for this fiscal year. Period Control The system automatically generates the correct calendar assignments for standard period control for Asset Accounting in a shortened fiscal year (see Period Control [Page 147]). However, since all possible period/calendar combinations cannot be one hundred percent predicted and resolved, you should check the assignments and correct them if necessary (FI-AA Customizing: Period Control). You can also manually initiate the generation of calendar assignments for a fiscal year (SAP Easy Access menu: Environment → Current Settings ). Reducing Depreciation In a shortened fiscal year, you generally reduce depreciation in proportion to the amount that the fiscal year is shortened. Therefore, you can define whether the system should reduce planned depreciation, or if the full year's depreciation should be calculated. You make this specification in Customizing for Asset Accounting.

You specify for each company code/depreciation area and depreciation type (ordinary depreciation, special depreciation, and so on), whether depreciation should be reduced or not (Valuation → Fiscal Year ). Specialized Depreciation Key In certain circumstances, the law stipulates depreciation cannot be reduced for certain depreciation methods (for example, a set percentage rate per year). Therefore, you can set an indicator in the Customizing definition of the depreciation key. When this indicator is set, depreciation cannot be reduced for this depreciation key, even though the definition at company code level specifies that depreciation should be reduced. Depreciation Levels in Shortened Fiscal Year Various depreciation keys (for example, for buildings) use special calculation methods. These methods have depreciation levels with time limitations, and specific depreciation percentage rates are set for each depreciation level (see Multi-Level Depreciation [Page 143]). These time limitations are set by entering the term of validity for the depreciation level in years and months (either in calendar years/months or fiscal years/months). A shortened fiscal year has the following affect on the definition of these depreciation levels: • If you reduce the level depreciation in the shortened fiscal year, the standard depreciation keys supplied by SAP will continue to depreciate correctly, since the useful life (measured in fiscal years) is lengthened in proportion to the reduction. You do not have to make any adjustments. The total period of validity as defined in the calculation method continues to correspond to the useful life in calendar years, and the depreciation in the shortened fiscal year is reduced proportionally to the shortening of the fiscal year.

April 2001 95 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Shortened Fiscal Years • If you allow for a full year's depreciation in the shortened fiscal year, then the useful life as measured in calendar years will be shortened. For multi-level depreciation, this means that the full percentage rate defined for the depreciation level will be used. If the shortened fiscal year falls in the validity period of a depreciation level that has a different percentage rate than the one following it, this has the following result: Since a validity period defined as a calendar year is longer than the shortened fiscal year, the system continues to depreciate beyond the end of the shortened fiscal year, using the defined percentage rate, although the full percentage was already depreciated in the shortened fiscal year. For this reason, using the standard key in this instance will not ensure that depreciation is correctly calculated. In this case, create your own depreciation key and correct the validity periods for the depreciation levels. Reduce the length of the validity period of the depreciation level in which the shortened fiscal year falls, according to the length of the shortened fiscal year. Adjust the next validity periods to reflect this change.

However, it is absolutely necessary that the start and end date be the same in Financial Accounting and in the Asset Accounting subsidiary ledger. (However, refer also to Different Fiscal Year Start or End in FI-AA [Page 100]). You might need a different fiscal year version in FI-AA in order for the system to correctly determine the start and end of depreciation using period control in Asset Accounting. The reason for this is that the calculation of depreciation works only with whole periods. For example, you have an acquisition on June 30 and the system is to calculate depreciation for half a year. However, the FI general ledger is using a version with 13 normal periods. Depreciation would have to be calculated for 6.5 periods.

For various reasons, you might also need to have a fiscal year variant for certain depreciation areas that is completely different from the fiscal year variant of the company code. This means that not only is the distribution of the periods within the fiscal year different from that for the company code, but also the start and end of the fiscal year are different. For example, the company code might use a fiscal year variant that goes from April to March, whereas accounting at the group level or for tax reporting requires a fiscal year variant from January to December.

The system then automatically supplies the corresponding posting documents with the additional values from these depreciation areas.

The system can also handle parallel currencies for depreciation areas that are posted periodically to the general ledger rather than online.

These components are: • These components are: MM (Materials Management) and • PM (Plant Maintenance) Features Purchase Requisition - Outline Agreement - Purchase Order (MM) If you post to an asset when entering a purchase requisition or an outline agreement, the system checks, with reference to the planned delivery date, whether the fixed asset actually exists and whether you can post to it. The same checks are carried out if you post to a fixed asset when entering a purchase order. Moreover, the system ensures that you do not exceed the upper limit for low-value assets. You can still change the asset, for which account assignment is to be performed, until receipt of the first goods or invoice for a purchase order. If you want to carry out account assignment to assets when creating purchase orders, purchase requisitions and outline agreements, the account entered in Financial Accounting for \"Acquisition and production costs\" must be assigned to a field status group that allows entries in the field groups \"asset number/sub-number,\" \"transaction type,\" and \"quantity.\" Goods Receipt (MM) Depending on the specifications in Materials Management Customizing, you can post the goods receipt for a purchase order as valuated or non-valuated. When the goods receipt is valuated, the system capitalizes the invoiced value of the goods (based on the purchase order) to the fixed asset. Non-valuated goods receipt is posted against a clearing account. In commercial law, the start-up date of a fixed asset normally determines the start of capitalization. The start-up takes place, for the majority of fixed assets, directly after the physical goods receipt. In most cases, therefore, you should post valuated goods receipts. Invoice Receipt",

The start-up takes place, for the majority of fixed assets, directly after the physical goods receipt. In most cases, therefore, you should post valuated goods receipts. Invoice Receipt (MM) You must decide whether invoice receipt takes place before or after goods receipt. If the invoice receipt is first, the invoice amount (minus taxes and, if applicable, cash discount) is capitalized to the asset. If the invoice receipt is second,, the difference between the invoice amount (without tax 106 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Integration (General) and cash discount) and the posted invoiced value of goods is capitalized, providing the goods receipt was valuated. For invoice receipt after a non-valuated goods receipt, the total invoice amount (minus tax and cash discount) is also capitalized. You determine whether cash discount should already be deducted at the invoice receipt by means of the document type you select. Material Reservation - Material Withdrawal (MM) If you have account assignment to an asset while making a material reservation, the system checks whether the asset actually exists. Material withdrawal with account assignment to an asset results in capitalization of the purchase or production costs of the material to the fixed asset. When creating a material withdrawal document, you can refer to a material reservation, if there is one. Settlement of Maintenance Orders and Production Orders (PM/PP) The system lets you enter assets as the receivers for the settlement of maintenance orders in the Plant Maintenance (PM) component.

Cost Planning You can determine planned depreciation and interest on a periodic basis for primary cost planning related to cost centers. Using a special report, you can transfer this depreciation and interest to primary cost planning in the Controlling (CO) component. For more information, see Primary Cost Planning [Page 526]. April 2001 107 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Integration (General) Account Determination Use Using the FI-AA component, you can automatically update all relevant transactions to the general ledger.

This update takes place immediately online for one depreciation area, or as part of periodic processing for all other depreciation areas. (refer to Updating Values in the Depreciation Area [Page 234] ).

This assignment is also binding for Asset Accounting Account Determination Key You enter the account determination key in the general master data for the asset class. The account determination key defines the reconciliation accounts in Financial Accounting that should be posted during asset transactions. This definition is effective for each chart of accounts and for each depreciation area that is defined as an automatic posting area in the respective chart of depreciation.

For every area that is defined for automatic posting, you can specify its own accounts in an account determination key. It is not possible to make specifications for account assignment for areas that do not have an automatic posting indicator in their area definition.

The system then determines the business area that is to be posted for each posting. The system makes this determination based on the business area entered in the asset master record, and transfers this information to Financial Accounting for the automatic posting. Cost Center/Internal Order You can make account assignment of the following accounting transactions (G/L accounts) to the cost center entered in the asset master record or to the internal order entered in the asset master record: • Loss due to scrapping • Gain/loss due to asset retirements • Clearing/expense from repayment of an investment support measure (as a result of asset retirement) • Revenue from post-capitalization • Revenue from write-ups (all depreciation types) The necessary conditions for this additional account assignment to CO are listed below: • A cost center or internal order has to be entered in the asset master data of the asset (in the section for “time-dependent data”) • The depreciation posting rules for the given area have to allow for additional account assignment to cost center or order (see System Settings for Posting Depreciation [Page 118]). • The field status variant of the company code/asset accounts has to allow additional account assignment to cost center/internal order as an optional entry ((FI Customizing: Financial Accounting Global Settings → Document → Line Item → Controls). 110 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Additional Account Assignment Graphic:",

Account Assignment of Depreciation and Interest You can post depreciation and interest to internal orders or cost centers. The posting program posts to the cost center or internal order that is entered in the asset master record. If both an order and a cost center have been entered in the asset master record, the system posts to both. However, it does check whether one of the two account assignments is only statistical. You specify the additional account assignment in the posting rules for the depreciation posting program in FI-AA Customizing (Depreciation → Post depreciation to the general ledger). This specification also determines the depreciation area for the additional account assignment. You can also post depreciation and interest to cost centers if you are using cost accounting that applies across company codes.

April 2001 111 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Additional Account Assignment Distribution of Depreciation and Interest It is only possible to enter one cost center in the asset master record. The only way to distribute depreciation and interest to different cost centers is to use settlement within cost accounting. The cost center in the asset master record then serves the function of a distribution cost center. The disadvantage of this approach is that reports show only the distribution cost center, and not the cost centers that are actually debited. Also, you need to enter a separate cost center for the distribution. A different approach is to follow this procedure: • Determine the cost center that you want to be shown in asset reports as the cost center of the asset. Enter this cost center in the asset master record. • Enter an internal order in the asset master record. The system posts to this order when it posts depreciation. The system does not post to the cost center. • Settle the \"distribution\" internal order to the cost centers that you want to debit. Account Assignment to Activity Type It is possible to enter an activity type in the asset master record along with the cost center.

Using this procedure, revenue and expense are displayed separately for each functional area. Features Since the expense due to depreciation also has to be accounted for, the depreciation posting program also posts to the functional area belonging to each asset. The system determines this functional area by means of a substitution rule (Customizing: Special Ledger). For this substitution rule, you can use all account assignment objects for fixed assets (for example, cost center). For additional account assignment to a functional area, it is not necessary that the depreciation area post depreciation to a cost center. The only requirement is that account assignment is made to a profit and loss account. If cost-of-sales accounting is active, then the depreciation posting program supplies values to the Functional area field for all depreciation areas. Make sure that the Functional area field is an optional entry field for the affected accounts and posting keys before you process the batch input session.

The same applies to program RAPOST00. Using document types limited to batch input is not possible when you use this program. It is also essential that you specify in the Customizing definition of the document type that the document type uses a number range with external number assignment. The depreciation posting program can then assign the document numbers itself (from the specified number range). If the numbers are assigned in this way, the depreciation posting program can keep a check on posting to Financial Accounting. If errors occur, this numbering also makes it possible to make corrections. Depreciation Areas to be Posted You decide which depreciation areas should have their values posted to Financial Accounting. You make this specification for each depreciation area per company code in Customizing for Asset Accounting (choose Integration with the General Ledger → Define How Depreciation Areas Post to General Ledger).

Depreciation Posting Cycle You determine the depreciation posting cycle by entering the length of time (in posting periods) between two depreciation posting runs. This means that a setting of 1 indicates monthly posting, 3 means quarterly posting, 6 means semi-annual, and 12 means annual (for a fiscal year version with 12 posting periods). When you start a depreciation posting run, you have to enter the period for which you want it to be carried out. You do not have to keep strictly to this posting cycle. You can also choose an unplanned depreciation posting run using an indicator in the initial screen of the depreciation posting program. When you set this indicator, you can skip over several periods, and post the total depreciation for all of the skipped periods in one period. You might need to do this, for example, if 118 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) System Settings for Posting Depreciation you carried out legacy data transfer during the fiscal year.

Then it determines the FI- AA period in which this date falls, and posts to this period. For example, you might enter period 1 for the depreciation posting run, but the system posts period 2. The reason for this difference is that January 31 falls in period 2 according to the fiscal year version in Asset Accounting. This problem occurs particularly when you use fiscal year variants that apply to specific depreciation areas. Posting Process The system supports two different procedures for distributing the forecasted depreciation over the posting periods. • Catch-up method Using the catch-up method, the system calculates the posting amount in this period as the difference between the planned depreciation and the depreciation posted up to this period. Acquisition posted in period 5 12000 Depreciation start in period 1 Planned annual depreciation 1200 Deprec. posted up to period 5 0 Planned deprec. up to period 5 500 Deprec. to post in period 5 = (500-0) = 500 Deprec. to post per period (5-12) = (6-12) = (700/7) = 100 • Smoothing Using the smoothing method, however, the system distributes the difference between the forecasted annual depreciation and depreciation already posted, to the remaining posting periods.

The depreciation posting program posts this amount in the period, in which the posting date of the acquisition lies. The amount posted is dependent on the asset value date. • With the smoothing method, this amount is distributed equally over the periods from the current posting period to the year end (independent of the asset value date of the transaction). Graphic: Catch-Up/Smoothing [Page 121] • You should be careful if you use smoothing, and the depreciation start date comes after the acquisition date. In this case, the system does not distribute the planned depreciation first to the periods after the depreciation start date. Instead, it posts depreciation starting from the acquisition date. However, the total amount of planned depreciation is not affected . • When an asset is retired during the fiscal year (partial or complete retirement) smoothing does not distribute depreciation only up to the retirement date; it distributes depreciation up to the end of the year.

These depreciation keys can be modified. In this way, you can define your own methods for calculating asset values. Interest calculation [Page 203] for imputed interest in cost accounting is treated as a depreciation type by the system, and is therefore also controlled by depreciation keys and calculation methods, similarly to the calculation of depreciation.

The system then issues an error message and rejects posting when you try to use a type of depreciation that is not explicitly allowed. Features The following depreciation or valuation types are supported: Ordinary Depreciation Ordinary depreciation is the planned deduction for wear and tear during normal use of an asset. Special Depreciation Special depreciation represents deduction for wear and tear on an asset from a purely tax-based point of view. This form of depreciation allows percentage depreciation, possibly staggered within a period allowed by the tax authority, without taking into account the actual wear and tear on the asset. Unplanned Depreciation Ordinary depreciation reflects the deduction for wear and tear during the normal use of the asset. Unusual influences, such as damage which leads to a permanent decrease in the value of the asset, are covered by unplanned depreciation. Transfer of Reserves/Reduction of APC Reduction of APC allows you to reduce the depreciation base of an asset by a given amount. This type of depreciation has to be posted manually. It cannot be posted automatically using depreciation keys like the other depreciation types. It is possible to illustrate this type of depreciation using income tax law in certain countries.

An example is the declining-balance method of depreciation, which never results in a net book value of zero. Apart from this, there may be legal regulations that allow or necessitate the changeover to another method. Therefore, when you assign calculation methods to a depreciation key, you can enter a changeover method. The changeover method specifies when the system should change over to a different calculation method (for example, Changeover when net book value percentage is reached). The changeover method also specifies the conditions under which the changeover takes place. You can also enter a net book value percentage for certain changeover methods. You can divide the duration of depreciation into several phases in the depreciation key. If you enter a changeover method for one of these phases, the system changes over to the next phase as soon as the event defined in the changeover method occurs.

If, for example, you were to post a post-capitalization after expiration of the useful life, you would have to use a different method. With changeover at the end of the planned useful life, the switch to a specified changeover method takes place at an exact period. With other changeover methods, the changeover takes place according to fiscal years. The changeover criteria are checked with reference to the total depreciation for the year, and the depreciation for the entire fiscal year is either calculated with the original key or with the new changeover key. • Changeover in next year as soon as straight-line higher (Poland) Functions the same as Changeover when depreciation amount of changeover method higher, except that the changeover does not take place until the following year. • User-defined changeover using a customer enhancement Using customer enhancement (customer exit) AFAR0003, you can define your own changeover methods.

Timing of the Changeover Generally, the system determines which phase in the depreciation key is to be used for calculating asset values only at the time of the carryforward of annual values.

However, the system does not calculate using two methods for one activity (that is, for the time period before the end of the planned useful life and the time period after the end of the planned useful life). The determining factor for deciding which method is valid is whether the asset value date for the activity (year-end carryforward or transaction) is before or after the end of the planned useful life. This means that a changeover after the end of planned useful life will only take effect, at a year-end carryforward, after the fiscal year is over in which the planned useful life ended. For a transaction, the system determines on an individual basis whether the value date is before or after the end of the planned useful life. 130 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Changeover Method A changeover to a different percentage rate or base value in the levels of a multi- level method is not considered a changeover method in the above",

April 2001 137 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Depreciation Calculation Methods Depreciation Calculation Methods Use The depreciation calculation method is the most important characteristic of the base method. The depreciation calculation method makes it possible to carry out the numerous different types of depreciation calculation in the system. Depending on how the depreciation calculation method is set up, the system determines which further control parameters need to be specified in the depreciation key and which do not. For example, when you choose the Stated percentage depreciation calculation method, you have to enter a percentage in the depreciation key. The depreciation calculation methods listed below are provided in the standard system. Features Percentage from Useful Life / Percentage from Remaining Useful Life There are two versions of this depreciation calculation method. In the first, the system determines a depreciation percentage rate from the total useful life; the rate remains the same for each year. The second version calculates a new percentage rate for each year based on the remaining useful life. In this version, the depreciation percentage rate rises constantly and then reaches 100% in the last year of the useful life. Total Percentage Rate in the Tax Concession Period This method allows you to depreciate a certain percentage rate from the depreciation base within a tax concession period. In order to calculate the current periodic depreciation, the system first determines the accumulated depreciation up to the period under examination. The period depreciation is the difference between the already existing depreciation and the total depreciation allowed. With subsequent acquisitions, the system automatically",

In order to calculate the current periodic depreciation, the system first determines the accumulated depreciation up to the period under examination. The period depreciation is the difference between the already existing depreciation and the total depreciation allowed. With subsequent acquisitions, the system automatically catches up depreciation from previous years in a lump sum. Stated Percentage Rate In contrast to a total percentage rate, here you specify the percentage rate for each fiscal year. The system uses this percentage rate for calculating depreciation for each period. For example, you can depreciate 3.5% in each of the first 12 years, then 2% a year for 20 years and 1% per year for the remaining 18 years. The total of the percentage rates over the useful life is logically always 100%, so that complete depreciation is reached by the end of the useful life. Percentage Rate from Remaining Life + Changeover Date - Depreciation Start Date This method is used as a changeover method (in the next phase in the depreciation key) following depreciation within the tax concession period of an investment support measure. The net book value of the asset will be depreciated over the total useful life when the tax concession period ends (that is, the actual duration of depreciation encompasses the tax concession period plus the total useful life that is entered). Mean Value from Several Areas When defining depreciation areas, you can establish dependencies between them by specifying a mathematical formula. This method allows you to calculate depreciation in one area based on the depreciation in another area using this mathematical formula. Using this method you can, for 138 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Depreciation Calculation Methods example, calculate the mean value from straight-line depreciation and declining balance depreciation.

Unit-of-Production Depreciation Unit-of-production depreciation is based on the output-related use of the asset. When you specify a total expected output or a total expected number of units, and the exact output per period or exact unit of production output figure per period, the system determines the resulting depreciation for each period. You enter the output or number of units at the level of the depreciation key. Depreciation Over Remaining Units of Production In the same way as with the unit-of-production method of depreciation, the amount of depreciation here is dependent on output. In contrast to the unit-of-production method of depreciation, the system uses the remaining units of production and not the total units of production to determine the periodic depreciation. Depreciating using the remaining units of production ensures that, for post-capitalization, the book value reaches zero when the total output or the total units of production is reached. Sum-of-the-Years-Digits Method An arithmetic sequence is set up based on the total useful life. The depreciation percentage rate is proportional to the remaining useful life. Depreciation According to the Present Value of Lease Installments This depreciation calculation method is designed for leased assets that have been capitalized using the capital lease procedure (refer to Leased Assets [Page 196]).

April 2001 139 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Ending Depreciation Ending Depreciation Use The depreciation of a fixed asset is usually finished when a net book value of zero or the end of the planned useful life has been reached. Sometimes, the book value has not yet reached zero when the useful life is expired, due to the depreciation method used. By adjusting the way the system handles the end of depreciation (in the base method), you can continue to depreciate beyond the end of the useful life. Features You specify how the end of depreciation is handled in the base method, which is independent of the chart of depreciation. However, you can enter default value for depreciation areas and company codes in Customizing for Asset Accounting (Depreciation → Valuation Methods → Depreciation Key → Default Values). Using such default values, you can maintain your base methods so that you have different ways of handling the end of depreciation in different depreciation areas and company codes.

Curb With depreciation beyond the planned useful life, the depreciation percentage rate can be derived, not only from the planned useful life, but also from the actual useful life. This method produces a declining-balance effect instead of a straight-line effect (curb). An asset that originally had a useful life of 10 years is depreciated in year 11 by 1/11 = 9.09 %, in year 12 by 8.33 % and in year n with 100/n %. When you use below-zero depreciation with a curb, the system determines the percentage rate, after the end of planned life, to the exact period and not to the year. Depreciation Below Zero It is also possible to depreciate below zero as long as the depreciation area allows a negative net book value. You have to set an indicator in the base method to allow this kind of depreciation. Depreciation below zero can, for example, be useful for cost-accounting purposes. If you choose an appropriate changeover method, you can also depreciate after the end of useful life using a different depreciation key. For more information, see Changeover Method [Page 129]. Reduce Useful Life at End of Fiscal Year Depreciation usually ends within the fiscal year due to the fact that the depreciation start date for the asset is also within the fiscal year. Using a setting in the base method, you can automatically reduce the useful life so that the close of depreciation always falls at the end of the fiscal year. 140 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Declining-Balance Method Declining-Balance Method Use Diminishing-rate depreciation includes both the declining-balance method, as well as the sum-of- the-years-digits method",

Features The normal declining-balance method of depreciation multiplies the straight-line percentage rate resulting from the useful life by a given factor. Since a relatively short useful life can produce a very large depreciation percentage rate, you can specify a maximum percentage rate as the upper ceiling limit in the declining-balance method. A similar principle applies for a very long useful life. Entering a minimum percentage rate prevents the percentage rate from sinking below a given level.

In this way, you can meet those legal requirements, for example, that allow depreciation for certain assets only up to a set amount. During the specified time period, the system calculates depreciation only until this amount is reached. The maximum amount method does not function in the same way as a maximum base value for depreciation [Page 145].

Since it is not logical to use every depreciation method with every base value, the base value is usually already determined by the depreciation method. The following base values are defined in the system: • Acquisition value • Acquisition value less unplanned depreciation • Replacement value • Half of replacement value • Average net book value without special depreciation • Current net book value • Limited base value (see below) • Your own base value based on a customer enhancement (AFAR0001) For more information, see the documentation of the customer enhancement (transaction SMOD.)

Limited acquisition value means that the system uses a given maximum amount as the base value. If the actual acquisition value of the asset is smaller than the maximum amount, then the system uses the actual acquisition value as the basis for depreciation. If the acquisition value of the asset is above this maximum value, the system depreciates from the maximum value that was set. You can set a maximum base value per depreciation area and asset class in a given company code. In addition, you can set a time limit on it by entering a \"valid to\" date. This time limitation applies to the capitalization date of the asset, and therefore can only be set once for each asset. It is, therefore, not possible to assign different maximum base values to an asset in the individual years during its useful life.

If you choose the asset value date, the system depreciates each acquisition to the asset starting from the asset value date of the individual acquisition posting. 146 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Period Control Method Period Control Method Use For determining the depreciation start and end date for asset transactions, you can set an appropriate period control in the period control method for the four transaction categories: • Acquisitions • Subsequent acquisitions/post-capitalization • Intracompany transfers • Retirements This enables you to set the depreciation start date for all acquisitions within the same year to the beginning of the year, for example. You can also set the depreciation start date for retirements to the first or last day of each period. Using the asset value date of a transaction (acquisition or retirement), the system determines the start date or end date of depreciation calculation using the period control.

You can, however, double the number of depreciation periods if the basic number of posting periods corresponds to the number of calendar months (12). By setting a control indicator when defining the company code, you can specify the use of half-periods.

You enter this memo value in the depreciation area (FI-AA Customizing: Valuation → Amount Specifications (Company Code/Depreciation Area) → Specify Memo Value). This memo value is then valid in this depreciation area for all assets. You can exempt certain asset classes (such as LVAs) from the memo value by means of an indicator in their asset class master record. The system reflects the memo value by reducing the planned annual depreciation of the acquisition year by the amount of the memo value. Usually you do not need to manage memo values, since Asset Accounting (FI-AA) always manages gross values. This means it records both the acquisition value and accumulated depreciation, not just the net book value of assets.

Post-capitalization and subsequent acquisitions necessitate an increase in depreciation, by the amount which would have been necessary to fully depreciate the addition over the original useful life of the asset. This results in an increase in the length of time necessary to depreciate the asset, that is, the time period from the beginning of depreciation until the book value of zero is reached. Calculation : Depreciation = APC / expected useful life APC: 1000 Useful life: 10 Depreciation = 1000 / 10 = 100 A depreciation key, which determines a percentage rate from expected useful life and uses the acquisition value or replacement value as the base value for depreciation, characterizes this depreciation method. Furthermore, certain depreciation keys (in their base method) allow depreciation below book value zero after the planned life has expired. In this case, the rate of depreciation can decrease after the planned life because you can then use the already expired useful life instead of the planned expected useful life to calculate depreciation. In the 11th year of use, you would not calculate with 10% as in the preceding 10 years, but only with 1/11 = 9.0909%.

However, unlike straight-line depreciation over the total useful life, this method ensures that post- capitalization and subsequent acquisitions do not lead to an extension of expected useful life. Post-capitalization or subsequent acquisitions after the expiration of the specified expected useful life do, however, cause problems in this depreciation method. In such cases, the changeover key in the depreciation key used has to provide for another method after the expiration of the expected useful life. Calculation : Depreciation = net book value / remaining life APC: 1000 Useful life: 10 Net book value: 500 Remaining useful life: 5 Depreciation = 500 / 5 = 100 You can represent this depreciation method in the system, for example, with a depreciation key that calculates a depreciation percentage rate from the remaining life, due to the depreciation calculation method Percentage from the useful life being set in its base method, and the Rem. life indicator being set in the multi-level method. Furthermore, the base value indicator \"24\" in the multi-level method ensures that the net book value is the basis for depreciation. The net book value and the remaining life are related proportionally, which results in straight-line depreciation. In the event of acquisitions after the expiration of the expected useful life, the depreciation key switches to a new phase after the planned end of useful life. The new phase is set up for straight- line/remaining life/pro rata/to zero/to end of life. As a result, these subsequent acquisitions are also depreciated completely. 154 April 2001 SAP AG Asset",

A constant percentage rate is calculated from the expected useful life and a given multiplication factor. This is multiplied with the falling net book value of the fixed asset. For mathematical reasons, the net book value will never reach zero using this method. You change over to straight-line or complete depreciation under these conditions: • Declining-balance depreciation < straight-line depreciation • Net book value < x percent of acquisition value • Net book value < fixed amount • Net book value < straight-line depreciation The changeover method is specified in the internal calculation key.

However, depreciation is only increased up to the maximum percentage rate that is specified in the depreciation key. Shutdown If an asset is shut down for a given period of time, you can suspend the depreciation as follows: • Define the appropriate time interval in the time-dependent data for the asset. • Set the shutdown indicator in the asset master record for this interval. • Use a depreciation key that allows shutdown, in the depreciation areas concerned. The system does not calculate depreciation during the time period of the shutdown. The useful life of the asset increases by this length of time. When you remove the shutdown indicator, the system automatically resumes the calculation of depreciation. Shutdown does not influence the calculation of interest to exact periods.

This depreciation method allows you to take fluctuations in activity into account for the depreciation calculation by linking the amount of depreciation in the given period directly to the output quantity. Features Depreciation Method The calculation of period depreciation is dependent on the depreciation calculation method used in the base method of the depreciation key. Two versions are possible in this case: • Depreciation of acquisition value over the total output The base value here is the acquisition value or the replacement value. • Depreciation of net book value over the remaining output Make sure that you use base value 27 (net book value with proportional value adjustments) when using this method. Specifications in the Depreciation Key For forecasting unit-of-production depreciation you have to modify a depreciation key that is dependent on the number of units. You have to modify one depreciation key for each total output quantity (application menu: Environment → Current Settings). • For the calculation of the unit-of-production depreciation, enter the probable total output quantity of the fixed asset (for the No. of units/remaining units depreciation method) or the remaining output (for the No. of units/total no. of units depreciation method). You can change the total output quantity, or the remaining output, to the exact periods.

April 2001 163 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Example: German Ordinary Depreciation Example: German Ordinary Depreciation Use Certain general requirements for depreciation stipulated in the German commercial code and German tax law are reflected in special depreciation keys that SAP provides: • End of depreciation Depreciation always ends when the net book value reaches zero, or when it reaches the memo value specified globally per depreciation area and company code, or when it reaches the scrap value specified in the asset. For German net worth tax purposes, SAP also provides special cutoff keys. However, these special keys are no longer required after 1993. If you need to take blanket percentage scrap values into account, you can create special scrap value keys. You enter these special keys in the depreciation key as the cutoff value key. • Acquisitions during the year of capitalization Either the system automatically sets the asset value date to the first day of the capitalization year according to the period control that has been entered; or the user sets the asset value date manually. • Acquisitions in subsequent fiscal years Additional acquisitions to existing assets are generally allowed.

You enter the declining balance multiplication factor in the declining-balance methods. At the time when this documentation was written, the prescribed depreciation key for new assets in Germany is DG30 with 3-times the straight-line rate, but a maximum of 30%. This depreciation key uses the formula: Depreciation = net book value * 3 / total useful life For existing assets you can use depreciation keys DG25 and DG20. In the year of acquisition, the first year convention of a half year is used, whereby the depreciation start date for acquisitions in the first half of the fiscal year is set to the first day of the fiscal year, so that a full year's depreciation is calculated for the asset.

GL20 / GL25 Buildings Straight-Line For the depreciation of buildings, you use depreciation keys that depreciate either 2% over a useful life of 50 years or 2.5% over 40 years. The percentage rates are set in the multi-level methods (14 or 15). In the year of capitalization, pro rata temporis is used, so that depreciation is calculated starting from the period of the first acquisition. Because of rounding, there can sometimes still be a book value when the useful life has expired. When there are subsequent acquisitions to a building, this results in a mandatory extension of the time period for depreciation.

The Complete depreciation depreciation calculation method is entered in the base method of the depreciation key. In conjunction with the recommended useful life of one period for low value assets, this depreciation calculation method results in the immediate complete depreciation of the asset in the period of its acquisition. You cannot post subsequent acquisitions in later fiscal years to asset with this depreciation key.

April 2001 167 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Replacement Values (General) Replacement Values (General) Use In addition to the historical acquisition and production costs of an asset, the Asset Accounting component enables you to work with the replacement value of the asset, which can provide a more up-to-date basis for calculating values. When determining replacement value, the system offers two options: Features Indexed Replacement Values Using index series, you can take periodic changes in value into account automatically. When depreciation is posted, these changes are reflected in the specific asset or asset class. Define the index series or index figures in Asset Accounting (Periodic Processing ). Enter the key of the index series in the section for asset valuation in the master record of the asset or asset class. The replacement value of an asset is influenced by two things. • On the one hand, the replacement value of an asset changes due to inflation. • On the other hand, technical progress leads to a changed price for an appropriate replacement acquisition. Therefore, you can specify two index series for each asset for determining replacement value in the Asset Accounting component. The replacement value is then determined by multiplying the index figures in the two index series.

Revaluation of Fixed Assets and Management of Inflation The system offers two options for handling changes in the value of all fixed assets in an enterprise: • Tax laws in your country may require you to carry out a single revaluation of the entire fixed asset portfolio, at intervals of several years, in order to offset the effects of inflation. In the system, you can use one-time revaluation measures [Page 175] for meeting these requirements. This one-time revaluation is not calculated automatically at the same time as depreciation. You have to define and carry it out manually. You can use collective processing to carry out this revaluation. To carry out periodic revaluation, choose Periodic Posting → Balance Sheet Revaluation → Post Revaluation. • Using periodic revaluation, you can keep track of and post the effects of inflation. To carry out periodic revaluation, choose Periodic Posting → Balance Sheet Revaluation → Inflation. For more information, see the SAP Library for CA – Country-Specific Documentation.

For example, a company concerned with inflation accounting can use this method to take actual reduction in the value of assets into account in its pricing policy. • For companies interested in the preservation of real asset values, they can use depreciation from replacement value as the basis of their reserves policy. Features Therefore, the cost-accounting depreciation area is set up in the standard system so that you can manage replacement values there. Current depreciation based on the replacement value is then periodically transferred to cost accounting when you carry out the depreciation posting run. However, it is also possible to define replacement values in depreciation areas that automatically post to the general ledger. In this way, the depreciation posting program automatically posts depreciation values, as well as changes to the asset balance due to revaluation (both upward and downward), to Financial Accounting. Insurance Values You can also use index values for determining insurable values. In many instances, the premium for an insurance contract is based on the indexed acquisition value of the asset. You can specify an index series for this purpose in the asset master record or in the depreciation area (see Insurance Values [Page 192]).

Age-dependent figures represent a yearly rate of change from the point in time when the asset was acquired. The year 1 has the index figure 100. • Year-dependent index figures are based on a specific fiscal year, and represent a rate of change from that base fiscal year. This base year has the index figure 100. You can use one index to reflect both inflation and technical progress, or you can set up two separate index series for these situations. For example, you can specify a year(inflation)- dependent and an age(progress)-dependent index for determining replacement value (in the detail screen of the depreciation area). When determining the replacement value, the system adds the index figures of the two index series.

In addition, the revaluation amounts that the system calculates on the basis of the current index figures are always related to the entire fiscal year (just like planned depreciation).

Refer to: For more information on periodic revaluation, see CA – Country-Specific Documentation. The procedure is described there using Argentina as an example. Features The system enables you to define revaluation measures in Asset Accounting and use collective posting to post them. You can manage revaluation values in any depreciation area. In accordance with the legal requirements in many countries, however, you must be able to separately identify such changes in value. In this case, you must use a separate depreciation area for each revaluation. You manage and depreciate the revaluation separately from APC and other revaluation in this depreciation area. You have to manage and depreciate revaluation in its own depreciation area, if you want to post depreciation of the historical APC to different value adjustment accounts than depreciation of the revaluation. Definition of Revaluation You define revaluation (time limitations, base depreciation area for the calculation of revaluation, and so on) in Customizing for Asset Accounting. For each revaluation, you define the depreciation area in which it should be carried out. In this way, it possible to manage and depreciate the revaluation separately in its own depreciation area. You can also define additional (already existing) depreciation areas for revaluation. Since the rules for revaluation vary widely according to the country and particular time, the system does not provide standard calculation rules for revaluation. However, there is an SAP enhancement project (ARVL0001). You can program your own revaluation rules and install them in the system with the help of this project.

Planning Revaluation Using Collective Posting If you wish to plan and post revaluation using collective posting, follow these steps: • Define the permitted revaluation and the corresponding depreciation areas in Customizing for Asset Accounting (Special valuation ). It is important to specify whether the revaluation should apply only to APC, or if it should also apply to accumulated depreciation from the past (backlog). • Maintain the depreciation terms of the new depreciation area in the affected asset classes (FI-AA Customizing: Valuation → Determine Depreciation Areas in the Asset Class). April 2001 175 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Graphic: System Settings for Replacement Values • Adapt the SAP enhancement project ARVL0001 to your specific requirements. Activate a customer enhancement project with this SAP enhancement project (see Definition of Revaluation [Ext.]). • Using the revaluation report, create a batch input session for posting the desired revaluation (Periodic processing → Post revaluation). In addition, the report creates a new depreciation area for all assets that are involved. This new depreciation area is the area in which revaluation is to be carried out, according to your specifications in Customizing. • Process the batch input session. The session plans the revaluation for each fixed asset in the corresponding depreciation areas. Manual Planning If you choose to plan revaluation manually, the revaluation report can still be used to create the depreciation areas required for the individual assets. If you choose, the report does not create a posting",

Manual Planning If you choose to plan revaluation manually, the revaluation report can still be used to create the depreciation areas required for the individual assets. If you choose, the report does not create a posting session in that case. For planning, use transaction type Rxx (xx = key of the revaluation). The system automatically creates this transaction type when you define the revaluation. If you want to post gross revaluation, that is, with the revaluation of historical depreciation (backlog calculation), use transaction type 800. Transaction type 800 is defined in the standard system so that it posts to all depreciation areas that allow for revaluation and backlog calculation in their Customizing definitions. If you want to limit the posting of gross revaluation only to specific depreciation areas, you have to change the Customizing definition of transaction type 800 accordingly (function Areas). Or copy transaction type 800 and change the copy. In this instance also, FI documents are not created until the periodic posting of the depreciation area to Financial Accounting is carried out. For more information on planning revaluation, see Revaluation [Page 419]. Settings for the Revaluation Depreciation Area Generally, you need to post the values from a depreciation area that is solely for revaluation (without APC) to the general ledger accounts along with values from the book depreciation area. The system does not create any FI posting documents when planning revaluation in the FI-AA component. Therefore, you have to define such revaluation depreciation areas with the following settings for posting. • You have to automatically post the changes to asset values due to transactions to the general ledger.

For more information, see Features at Chart of Depreciation Level [Page 70] . • Maintain the depreciation posting rules for the depreciation area (Post depreciation to the general ledger ). The depreciation posting program then posts the values (depreciation and the planned changes to asset values through revaluation) from this area to the appropriate general ledger accounts (see Posting Depreciation [Page 116]). The system enters the posting date of the last revaluation in the asset master record (Extras → Master data info). 176 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Graphic: System Settings for Replacement Values The fundamental rule, of course, is that only one depreciation area can be posted automatically in realtime to the General Ledger.

You make this determination when entering the depreciation areas in which the support measure should be carried out.

For this purpose, book depreciation is carried out according to the appropriate requirements, and the depreciation allowed by tax law, which exceeds book depreciation, is shown as special reserves on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The “special reserves” component allows you to show the difference between book depreciation and tax depreciation in a derived depreciation area.

If such reserves are not transferred in the year in which they arise, because there are no appropriate new acquisitions, then a reserve can be created. In this way the gain from the sale of the asset does not count as profit. This reserve usually must be transferred within the following (two) years to new assets acquired during this",

This reserve usually must be transferred within the following (two) years to new assets acquired during this time period. Features It is possible to post this transfer of reserves to replacement assets in the FI-AA Asset Accounting component. The allocation of gain resulting from asset sales (as special items with reserves) must be posted manually in the FI General Ledger. You manage and depreciate the reserves transferred to assets separately from the acquisition and production costs. The following explanations relate to the standard chart of depreciation for Germany (refer to Special Reserves in Germany [Page 77]). Other countries, in which the transfer of reserves is allowed, require similar depreciation areas. The following describes the different methods for managing reserves transferred to an asset in the system: Handling on the Assets Side Using this method, the acquisition and production costs of the asset are reduced by the amount of the transferred reserve. Ordinary depreciation and special depreciation are then automatically calculated by the system based on the reduced acquisition and production costs. The reserves transferred to the asset cannot be identified separately from the actual acquisition and production costs. In order for this calculation to take place, you define the book depreciation area (01), and the tax depreciation area (02) so that they allow for the management of values for the transfer of reserves. You do not need the area for \"special depreciation\" (03), since the transfer into the areas 01 and 02 must be of the same amount. For the transfer of reserves, therefore, you should use a transaction type that posts to area 01 and area",

You must also enter the appropriate accounts for the transfer of reserves in the account allocation for the book depreciation area: • Offsetting account for the transfer of reserves • Control account for transferred reserves (=asset control account) Posting on Liabilities Side In this case, the transferred reserves can be represented in the balance sheet as value adjustments on the liabilities side. The calculation of depreciation in the book depreciation area is then based on the unreduced acquisition and production costs. The following options exist: April 2001 189 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Transferred Reserves (Deferred Gain) • Posting in special reserves depreciation area (03) If your accounts in Financial Accounting do not differentiate between reserves for special depreciation that arise from transferred reserves and those that arise from other special tax depreciation (for example, in Germany, the law providing tax credits for investment in the new states), then you can use area 02 \"special depreciation based on the trade balance sheet acquisition and production costs,\" and the derived depreciation area 03 (\"special reserves\"). However, the system posts to the accounts for area 03 (expense from allocation to reserves and special reserve account) during the transfer of reserves. Allow for the management of values for transferred reserves in area 02 and 03. Post the reserves with a transaction type that only posts to area 02.

This area is only used to manage the transferred reserves (not APC). The clearing of the reserves is carried out by normal depreciation. Carry out these tasks when configuring the system: – Define the special depreciation area (area 04). Allow for the management of negative book values. Do not allow APC in depreciation area 04. Also specify that the depreciation and asset values from this area are posted periodically to the general ledger (FI-AA Customizing: (Valuation → Depreciation Areas → Define depreciation areas). – Specify that area 04 is for managing reserves (FI-AA Customizing: Special Valuation → Transferred Reserves (Deferred Gain)). Make sure that area 04 is not allowed to manage investment support (FI-AA Customizing: Special Valuation → Investment Support). – Specify that area 04 is for managing positive ordinary depreciation (FI-AA Customizing: Depreciation → Ordinary Depreciation → Determine depreciation areas). – Maintain the account allocation for area 04.

Make sure that the affected assets have the same depreciation terms in areas 01 and 04, in order to ensure parallel depreciation of the APC and the reserves. If you want to see the values from book depreciation along with the transferred reserves, you have to define an additional, derived depreciation area (05). Define area 05 so that its values are calculated from adding book depreciation and area 04.

The insurance companies require certain values and information relevant to the insurance policies. You need to manage this information on an individual asset basis in the system. The Insurance component enables you to manage insurance master data and insurance values for fixed assets. The current insurance values can be stored in the asset master record, or managed in a separate depreciation area. You can also increase or decrease the insurable value using index series. Features The system offers three methods of calculating the insurance value: • Value as new insurance For value as new insurance, the APC or the indexed APC are used for the calculation of insurance value. By indexing you can account for price rate increases when determining the insurance value. For example, the current insurance value for fire insurance for buildings is often based on index series that are published by the insurance carrier. • Current market value insurance With current market value insurance, the APC, reduced by depreciation (that is, the book value) determines the insurance value. You can also use indexing for current market value insurance. • Manual insurance value A special method is setting the insurance value manually in the master record. The insurance value is usually determined through agreement with the insurance carrier. Insurance Type The insurance type is the most important control feature for maintaining the insurance values. You define the different insurance types in Customizing for Asset Accounting.

You can use an area that is already set up (for example, book depreciation). • Determining current market value (for current market value insurance) Here you can also use the current book values of an existing area. In order to be able to use reporting to your best advantage, however, it is recommended that you define a separate depreciation area for updating the insurance current market values. • Currency specifications and rounding 192 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Insurance Values The insurable value is managed in the currency of the depreciation area of the company code.

Insurance Value You can display the insurance value for all fiscal years up to the current fiscal year. Depending on the type of insurance, the system then determines the insurance value based on the following: • Value as new insurance The insurance value is determined by the base insurable value: Insurable value = (base insurance value + (asset transaction outstanding years * 100 / index of transaction year)) * index of current year / 100 Transactions from the outstanding fiscal years consist of acquisitions, transfer postings and asset retirements. The average index of the increase of the base insurance value, and not the index of the respective retirement year, as specified in the formula, is used as the best approximation when asset retirements are included: Index Prop. = 100 * accumulated APC beginning of the year / base insurance value beginning of the year For transfer acquisitions to fixed assets that have already been posted, the transfer acquisition is also valued with the \"Index Prop\" as with asset retirements. During transfer acquisitions to a new fixed asset, the transfer acquisition is valued with the index of the acquisition year from the depreciation area. • Current market value insurance − For indexing in the depreciation area itself, the insurance value is equal to the book value of the fixed asset. − If indexing is not carried out in the depreciation area, the following possibilities exist: − If there",

There are two scenarios: − If the insurance value was set once, and was not changed by subsequent acquisitions or indexing, then you have to specify the insurance value and the Manual insurance value indicator in the asset master record. − The situation can arise that an insurance value has been manually set at one point, but in following years it should be indexed, or is influenced by transactions affecting the asset. In this case you cannot set the Manual insurance value indicator. You have to specify a maintenance year, in addition to the manual insurance value.

During the term of the lease, leased assets remain the property of the lessor or manufacturer. They represent, therefore, a special form of rented asset. Such assets are legally and from a tax perspective the responsibility of the lessor, and are not relevant for assessing the value of the asset portfolio of the lessee. However, in certain countries, you are nonetheless required to capitalize leased assets, depending on the type of financing. The Leased Assets component enables you to capitalize leased assets in the Asset Accounting (FI-AA) component using the capital lease method. The system calculates the acquisition value from the present value of the future lease payments in the leasing agreement. Features There are different ways of handling the values of leased assets in the system. Depending on legal requirements and the conditions of the lease, there are two different options: • You have to capitalize and depreciate certain leased assets (capital lease). • You treat others as periodic rent expense, which flows into the profit and loss statement (operating lease). This second type is not relevant to the fixed assets of the lessee. It is therefore sufficient to do one of the following: – Manage operating leases as statistical assets in the Asset Accounting component (with no active depreciation areas) – Manage them only as cost-accounting values (or for group accounting) in the corresponding depreciation areas There is a special report on rent liability that can be used for all types of",

You can also manage insurance values for purely statistical leased assets (without depreciation areas). You enter a manual insurance value and an index series for the leased assets in the asset master record. You obtain reports on these values using the standard report for insurance values. Capital Lease Method Leased assets can be capitalized in the Asset Accounting component using the capital lease method. The system calculates the acquisition value from the present value of the future lease payments in the leasing agreement. To be able to determine the future burden of payment, you need to maintain the following leasing conditions in the asset master records: • Amount of lease payment • Number of payments • Payment cycle 196 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Leased Assets In order to calculate present value, also enter an interest rate. The system requires that you post a leasing partner as a vendor in the asset master record at the time of the acquisition posting (opening posting). At the present time, the capital lease method can only be used for assets that are capitalized in the book depreciation area. An opening posting with simultaneous creation of leasing liability is not possible for assets that have only cost-accounting depreciation areas.

Therefore, you have to enter the net lease payments in the asset master record. In addition, set the input tax indicator V0 (= no input tax) in the respective leasing type (see below). In this way, you can ensure that there is no posting of input tax at the time of capitalization. Instead, you should post the input tax directly in the Financial Accounting (FI) component (debit input tax and credit vendor) at the time of payment. Leasing Type You define leasing types in Customizing for Asset Accounting. The leasing type is a selection criterion in reporting, and the most important control feature for the posting of acquisitions to a leased asset. It determines the following: • The transaction type used for the acquisition posting of a leased asset. The transaction type controls the depreciation areas in which the capitalization posting takes place (such as book depreciation, group depreciation, and so on). You define the transaction type in Customizing for Asset Accounting. • Different specifications for posting to Financial Accounting (for example, document type, input tax indicator, and so on.) • The bookkeeping treatment of the leased asset You can set the depreciation area for automatic posting to active or inactive in each asset class for leased assets. This determines whether the acquisition of leased assets is posted to G/L accounts.

Just set the corresponding cost-accounting depreciation areas to active (posting to general ledger: inactive) in the asset class of the assets in question. This ensures that no posting is made to Financial Accounting in the event of asset acquisition. You can still use periodic depreciation in active depreciation areas for cost-accounting purposes. Graphic: Operating Lease Procedure [Page 201] • Leased assets capitalized in the general ledger with interest accrued (capital lease) In some countries, you are required to capitalize leased assets for book depreciation or for tax purposes. In this case, you have to manage the leased asset in an area that posts April 2001 197 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Leased Assets to the general ledger (generally the book depreciation area). Set posting in the general ledger to active in the corresponding leased asset classes. In addition, enter specifications for posting to Financial Accounting in the leasing types.

In this case, define the clearing account for the interest portion and the vendor account so that they are both displayed in the same item of the balance sheet. Periodic Posting The depreciation posting program posts the depreciation of leased assets and the write-off of the interest. You can use any depreciation key. The standard R/3 System includes a special depreciation key, in which the depreciation amounts correspond to the present value of the periodic leasing payments (LEAS). Using this key, interest is determined as the difference between the leasing payments and the present value. Calculation of Present Value The present value of the leased asset is calculated on the basis of the following specifications: g : Amount of lease payment i : Annual interest rate n : Number of lease payments r: Leasing cycle (for example, 3 = quarterly, 6 = semiannual) m : Number of periods in a year q : Period interest factor = 1 + ( i / 100 * r / m) If payment is made at the beginning of the period, the present value then results from the following formula: Present value = g + g * q** (n-1) - 1 / (q**n-1 * (q - 1)) With payment at the end of the payment period, on the other hand, the present value is calculated as follows: Present value =",

Features Interest calculation is controlled in the same way as depreciation calculation, using a depreciation key. In addition to the base value for the calculation (for example, acquisition value or replacement value), you can also specify the interest rate using the calculation method of the depreciation key.

Calculation of Interest The calculation of interest to be posted depends fundamentally on the base value of the interest key. When you use an interest key that uses the current net book value as the base value, this net book value is taken into account to the exact period during depreciation posting. Therefore, the planned value for the distribution during the fiscal year is not the planned book value at the end of the year. Instead, the system uses the net book value determined in the posting period (period net book value). An example of a depreciation key of this kind is the interest from the mean net book value, which is calculated as follows: Interest amount = (NVSY + NVPER) / 2 * Interest rate / 100 NVPER = Net book value in period NVSY = Net book value at fiscal year start Concrete example: Asset: Net book value at start of year = APC = 12000, useful life 10 years, straight- line depreciation = 10% 1.

Similar problems can occur when posting depreciation, if the base value for depreciation is also the exact net book value in the period. Prerequisites If you would like the system to calculate interest in a depreciation area, make the following system settings: • Specify that interest should be managed in the depreciation area. • Define depreciation posting in this company code and in this depreciation area so that interest should be posted. • Use a depreciation key that has an interest key assigned to it for calculating interest (or define such a key yourself). The system then posts interest together with depreciation when you perform a periodic depreciation posting run. Account assignment is to the accounts specified in the given depreciation area in the account determination.

The “net worth tax” component helps you to valuate assets for this purpose. You can use the values the system calculates in determining your net worth tax burden. Features If the property values are to be depreciated, it makes sense to set up an independent depreciation area for the net worth tax valuation. You then mark this area as the depreciation area for the valuation of net assets when you maintain the asset company codes. The values in this depreciation area are available for special reports, such as the property list. The structure of this list is determined by the property classification key, which you specify in the master record. If net worth tax in your country is based on normal tax valuation, then it is not necessary to create a separate depreciation area for it. You can simply use the values from the tax depreciation area. Manual Property Value If the property value is not to be depreciated (for example, assessed value), you can store a manual property value in the master record. However, you then have to set the Manual property value indicator. The net worth tax reports in the system then use these values, even if you do not manage a depreciation area for net worth tax.

April 2001 205 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Requirements for Consolidation Requirements for Consolidation Use The “requirements for consolidation” component assists you in preparing the for the legal consolidation of a corporate group as relates to fixed assets, using the data in asset accounting. Features For the purposes of consolidation or reporting, you can manage each depreciation area in the system in any desired currency. The exception is the master area (01). The master area always has to use the local currency of its company code. The currency is a feature of the depreciation area at company code level (FI-AA Customizing: Foreign Currencies). For depreciation areas managed in a foreign currency, all acquisition transactions are converted into the foreign currency at the exchange rate valid on the posting date. The system calculates depreciation and proportional value adjustments at asset retirement or transfer directly in the foreign currency. Depreciation Areas for Consolidation Generally you need a depreciation area in a foreign currency, when your company code is a foreign subsidiary that uses different rules for valuation than its parent company. Usually, you manage a separate corporate group ledger for the group consolidation in the general ledger. The values of the corporate group depreciation area should be posted to the corporate group ledger. In this case, you must also manage a depreciation area in the local currency that is otherwise identical to the area managed in the foreign/group currency.

You must define the foreign currency depreciation area so that it automatically adopts the posting values and valuation parameters from the corporate group area in local currency, making sure that these values cannot be changed. In addition, you need a depreciation area in foreign currency with the local rules for valuation. Overall, when your group has a different currency and uses different depreciation terms, you need four depreciation areas in order to ensure correct consolidation values. These depreciation areas should manage: • Local valuation and local currency • Local valuation and group currency • Group valuation and local currency • Group valuation and group currency This is the only way to precisely distinguish between differences resulting from currency translation and differences due to different local valuation rules during the consolidation process. For more information on consolidation in the R/3 System, see the documentation for the Consolidation (FI-LC) [Ext.] component, and the section on Parallel Currencies in the General Ledger [Page 103]. 206 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Requirements for Consolidation Posting of the Corporate Group Area to the General Ledger Posting depreciation from the group depreciation area in a foreign currency works the same as it does for of the book depreciation area.

Use the appropriate posting program (refer to Parallel Valuation [Page 507]). For these postings, the system uses the consolidation transaction type that corresponds to the transaction type that was originally used for these postings. The system determines the original transaction type from the FI document that was posted online to the local ledger. You specify the consolidation transaction types in the transaction types definitions in FI-AA Customizing. Using the consolidation transaction type is important for the group ledger. It ensures that the type of transaction is also available in the group ledger for reports, such as the asset history sheet. The system requires the posting amount both in the foreign currency and in the local currency for the group consolidation. Therefore, the system posts the amount in group currency from the group depreciation area to the corporate group ledger, in addition to the amount in the local currency from the group depreciation area managed in local currency. Each document, therefore, contains the amount in group currency as well as in the local currency. The system posts the amount in group currency as the transaction currency for the document. It posts the local currency amount as the local currency for the document. If you do not have special requirements in regard to consolidation, and only want to have reports in foreign currencies, you do not necessarily have to manage a separate depreciation area in the foreign currency.

It always consists of the main asset number and the asset sub-number. There are two ways of carrying out number assignment in the system: • External number assignment • Internal number assignment In the case of external number assignment, the user directly assigns the asset number. The system displays only the defined number interval, and issues an error message if a number is already assigned. In the case of internal number assignment, the system automatically assigns consecutive numbers. Do not use hyphens or the asterisk (*) symbol with external number assignment. Features Number Range Intervals You define the number ranges at company code level. In Customizing for the asset class, specify the number range per company code, and specify whether assignment from the number range should be carried out externally or internally. Alphanumeric intervals can only be assigned externally. You should choose sufficiently large intervals, since an extension is not possible if the extension already belongs to another interval.

When the last number of the interval has been assigned, the system issues a further warning. You should pay attention to these warnings and extend the intervals in time or assign a new number range for the asset classes involved. Cross-Company Code Number Assignment If you want several company codes to use the same number assignment (cross-company code), you can maintain the number range in one company code, and assign the other company codes to this company code for number assignment. Cross-company code number assignment in Customizing for Asset Accounting (Define Cross- Company Code Number Assignment): Company code 0001 Company code 0002 Num.assgn.CC 0001 Num.assgn.CC 0001 Example of a cross-company number assignment in chronological order (for internal number assignment): CoCode 0001 CoCode 0002 April 2001 211 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Number Assignment 1.asset 10001 2. 10002 3. 10003 4. 10004 5. 10005 6. 10006 7. 10007 Asset Main Number The asset main number has 12 alphanumeric characters.

The first sub-number is assigned at the same time as the main number and is noted as a main asset master record. You do not have to define number ranges for the sub-number assignment. You specify in the asset class whether sub-numbers are assigned externally or internally. • In the case of internal assignment, the sub-numbers are assigned consecutively for each main number starting with \"0000\". • When you use external assignment, you can use your own method for assigning numbers. It is recommended that you devise your own method, especially for complex fixed assets that have component parts. In this way, you can look at and report on the sub-numbers for certain asset components at the same time by using the generic selection of sub-numbers. 212 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Number Assignment April 2001 213 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Screen Layout, Maintenance Level, Tab Layout for Master Data Screen Layout, Maintenance Level, Tab Layout for Master Data Use The asset master record in the FI-AA component has a large number of fields in order to meet the needs of its many functions.

You can define as many types of screen layout control as you need, and enter them in the asset classes (Customizing Master Data). There is screen layout control for • General master data • Depreciation terms in the master record (depreciation areas) In each screen layout control, you can make specifications for the individual field groups. The corresponding maintenance fields are assigned to every field group. Screen layout control → Field groups → Individual fields The field groups and their respective fields are defined in system tables. When you define the screen layout, the system proposes all existing field groups, and you maintain each one individually. You define specifications for the screen layout and for the maintenance level of the field groups, and you specify whether the field contents can be copied as a reference. SAP supplies several predefined screen layout controls. In regard to depreciation terms (areas), the system offers the following depreciation procedures: • Depreciation terms are maintainable on sub-number level • Depreciation is uniform for main assets and their sub-numbers • Depreciation is uniform for the asset class Using the screen layout, you control whether the fields of the field group are required fields, optional fields, display fields, or whether they should be suppressed completely (that is, not appear at all",

For required fields, an entry is always mandatory in master data maintenance. You can choose whether to make entries in optional fields. You can only define field groups as display fields if the system determines the values in these fields (for example, insurance value). If you suppress all field groups of a screen, the screen is not displayed during master data maintenance. By using the screen layout to control fields, you guarantee that the necessary fields are processed for each asset class. Each field group can have only one value in the screen layout. 214 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Screen Layout, Maintenance Level, Tab Layout for Master Data Only fields that are blank or 0 can be suppressed using the screen layout control.

Instead these fields are for display only at those levels. The values for these fields are copied from the asset class to the main number and sub-number. Later changes to these field values in the asset class are not reflected in existing master records (main number and sun-number), but apply only to newly created assets. • Main number only If you specify the main number as maintenance level for a field group, you can only maintain these fields when creating or changing the main number.

It makes sense to maintain some of these fields separately for each asset, since they apply only to one asset (for example, the base insurable value and other value fields containing insurance data). You cannot define a maintenance level for fields which are suppressed by means of the screen layout. Tab Layout Due to the large number of fields, the asset master record is split up onto different screens and tab pages using tab layout functions. In Customizing (Master Data), you can specify how many tabs you want to have (up to a maximum of 8) and which field groups you want to be displayed on the given tab pages. You can make these specifications dependent on the asset class.

For every asset view, you can determine in FI-AA Customizing which field groups of the master record are maintained, displayed only, or suppressed for this view (Asset views). Features It is only possible to maintain all master data fields of an asset using view 1 (asset accounting view). To avoid inconsistencies between the screen layout control and the view control when creating a master record, you should define this view in such a general way that it allows you to maintain all field groups that are defined as required fields in a screen layout control. If the field maintenance based on the screen layout control is inconsistent with the asset view, the field parameter default takes precedence. This parameter is a more stringent protection of the field. Incomplete Assets It is possible to create assets when working with an asset view that only allows limited access to asset master records, but these assets will be incomplete. “Incomplete” means that all required entries were not made, because the asset view does not have authorization for this master data.

For more information, see Workflow Scenarios in Applications [Ext.] As an alternative to Workflow, you can use a special report (under Tools) for selecting incomplete assets (refer to Processing Incomplete Assets [Page 546]). Access to Depreciation Areas You can also assign a view for the depreciation area specifications in the asset master record. When you assign an asset view to a depreciation area, you can only maintain the depreciation terms of this depreciation area in the asset master record if you have the assigned asset view. However, your specifications apply to the entire depreciation area in this case, and not to individual field groups.

You make these specifications in FI-AA Customizing (Define validation/Define substitution). Features Validation You create your own validation conditions, which serve as check rules when you create an asset master record. These customized check rules supplement the standard check rules. A validation condition consists of the following: • Company code • Specification of the point in time for the check • Validation rule A validation rule consists essentially of the following elements: • Condition, under which the rule should be checked (such as, if the asset class is LVA) • Check rule, that cannot be broken (such as depreciation key is GWG1 or GWG2) • Number of the error message that the system should produce if the check rule is violated You must define check rules and conditions which conform to Boolean logic. The system checks the validation conditions when you change to a new screen while creating an asset master record. If a check rule is violated, the system displays an error message. You specify the number of this error message in the validation rule. You have to create this error message yourself (transaction SE61).

The most important part of the substitution is the substitution rule. A substitution rule consists primarily of the following: • The conditions under which the rule should be checked • Substitution if the requirements are met (setting of a constant value in a particular master record field). Or you can use a substitution exit with program code that determines the value to be entered in the master record field. You define the substitution rules in FI-AA Customizing. They are based on Boolean logic, as the validation rules are. You can still change values that have been proposed on the basis of substitution rules. You can change these values manually in the master data transaction. Values that you change manually are not changed again by the substitution rule.

April 2001 229 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Archiving and Reorganization Basic Functions of Transactions Purpose The “transactions” component enables you to carry out all accounting transactions that occur during the life of a fixed asset in your organization. Integration Asset Accounting is a subsidiary ledger of Financial Accounting, along with Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. The Asset Accounting component makes it possible to perform all business transactions that affect fixed assets, in integration with Financial Accounting and other R/3 SAP System components, while at the same time guaranteeing parallel updating to the general ledger and the subsidiary ledger. 230 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA)",

A transaction type has to be entered for each transaction that affects assets. Either you make this entry yourself in the posting transaction, or the entry is automatic, based on specifications made in FI-AA Customizing (Transactions). Features Each transaction type is assigned to a transaction type group. The business transactions are subdivided on the basis of the transaction type group into: • Transactions that influence the acquisition and production costs of fixed assets These include: Acquisitions, retirements, transfer postings, post-capitalization • Down payments • Investment support measures • Manual depreciation • Write-ups Specifications (Transaction Type Group) The transaction type group, to which a which a transaction type belongs, determines the following: • Which value fields are updated in the year segments • Whether the transaction refers to the past (for example write-ups) or to the current fiscal year • Whether the total of the transactions of a group is positive or negative with reference to a fiscal year • According to which rule the start period for the depreciation calculation is determined • In which G/L accounts posting is to take place • Whether the acquisition date of the fixed asset is set on the date of the first transaction of a group • Whether proportional accumulated depreciation can be entered for a transaction (for example during post-capitalization), or is to be determined by the system (for example with asset retirements).

The number of possible transaction type groups, as well as the characteristics of the individual groups, is specified in the system and cannot be changed. The system carries out a check for the asset class of the fixed asset involved when you post with a transaction type of the down payment group. This means that you can only post to fixed assets using these transaction types if you defined this in the asset class. Specifications (Transaction Type) The individual transaction types determine the following: April 2001 231 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Transaction Types Transaction Type controls - Capitalization of asset - Deactivation of asset - Credit/debit indicator - Acct assignmt to project - Document type Account Assignment Account Assignment - Retirement with revenue - Gain/loss on retirement - TTy for offsetting posting - Same year aquisition - Repayment of investment support Retirement/Transfer Retirement/Transfer - Transaction in past - Post to affiliated company - Consolidation program - Not for manual use Other Other Specifying Transaction Types Some of these specifications are dependent on the transaction type group, and are mutually exclusive. You cannot make specifications that are inconsistent with the transaction type group. SAP provides a number of transaction types that cover most common business transactions.

For each transaction, a line item is created for each depreciation area in which posting is to take place. This line item contains the transaction type, asset value date, posted amount, depreciation, and interest on a transaction as well as any proportional value adjustments. Features If posting is integrated with Financial Accounting, the line items created refer to the number of the corresponding posting document. When you display asset values, you can also look at the line items for the values displayed. Proof of Origin There is a special report in the system for displaying the origin of individual line items. This report lists the origin of transactions that affect acquisition value in a fiscal year. See the documentation for the Investment Management (IM) component in the SAP Library. Original Document In certain circumstances, it may not be possible to obtain a clear proof of origin for the following transaction types: purchase acquisition, intracompany asset transfer, acquisition against clearing account, and goods receipt. If this is the case, the system attempts to determine the origin using plausibility checks, but the transactions are marked with a question mark (?).

April 2001 233 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Updating Values in the Depreciation Area Updating Values in the Depreciation Area Use Depending on the specifications in the chart of depreciation and in the asset class, you can manage multiple depreciation areas per asset in the Asset Accounting (FI-AA) component. (The maximum number is 99, refer to Depreciation Areas [Page 65]). Features You implicitly or explicitly specify the depreciation areas where value field update is carried out when you post: • Explicit specification In the definition of the transaction type, you select certain depreciation areas for posting (in Customizing for Asset Accounting, choose Transactions). • Implicit specification If no explicit specification of this type was made for a transaction type, value update is carried out in the book depreciation area and in all areas which, according to the transfer logic defined in the chart of depreciation, are directly or indirectly dependent on this area. (See Features at Chart of Depreciation Level [Page 70]) If the book depreciation area is not active (for example, for leased assets), posting is carried out in all areas marked as dependent. Transfer Logic for Acquisitions When you post acquisitions, you can manually enter different posting amounts in each depreciation area (using the function Areas in the posting transaction). If you explicitly enter an alternative posting amount for a depreciation area manually, all areas dependent on this area are updated. Dependent areas whose amounts were already corrected manually are not updated. In some functions of",

If you explicitly enter an alternative posting amount for a depreciation area manually, all areas dependent on this area are updated. Dependent areas whose amounts were already corrected manually are not updated. In some functions of the area menu (such as acquisition with automatic offsetting entry), it is not possible to enter values for different areas manually. If you want to use such a function anyway, then you can enter the transaction code manually, leaving off the last letter (for example, ABZO rather than ABZON). The system then calls the transaction in the form from a prior Release level, and you can enter differing posting amounts in it. Transfer Logic for Retirements In the case of asset retirements and transfer postings, the transfer logic of the chart of depreciation does not apply. For each area with values and for which the transaction type has determined that posting should be made, the system determines the proportional retirement amount and the proportional accumulated depreciation. Currency Translation If a dependent area is managed in a different currency from the reference area, amounts are translated into the currency of the dependent area. The posting date of the document is generally used as the value date for currency conversion. 234 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Quantity Treatment Quantity Treatment Use Particularly in the case of low value assets, it is often preferable not to manage a separate asset master record for each individual fixed asset.

Features Therefore, you can manage any number of assets in a single master record using collective management. The only requirement is that you enter a basic unit of quantity in the asset master record for the collective asset. When you post to such an asset, the system updates for this quantity, according to the debit/credit indicator of the transaction. When an acquisition is posted to a collective asset for low value assets, the system checks, per unit, whether the acquisition posting exceeds the maximum amount for low value assets. The acquisition and production costs of the collective asset, plus the total of the amounts posted from the current document, are divided by the total quantity. The value determined in this way is compared with the upper limit which has been set for LVAs. Quantity-Related Retirement A quantity-related retirement is always a partial retirement. There is a restriction in the system for partial retirements which stipulates that any existing postings to the asset are restricted to either asset acquisitions from previous years, or current acquisitions. Otherwise the system cannot clearly assess whether the partial retirement applies to acquisitions from previous years or to current acquisitions. The system determines a percentage rate for the retirement amount based on the ratio between the quantity being retired and the total quantity. If the above-mentioned restriction does not apply to the quantity based asset retirement, you can specify the quantity as additional information.

In addition, the screen layout has to specify that the Quantity field can be changed, or at least displayed (refer to Screen Layout and Maintenance Level [Page 214]). If you want to suppress this field, suppress it using the maintenance level, not the screen layout. • If you post asset retirements and acquisitions with quantity specifications to balance sheet accounts, you have to specify the quantity in the field status variant of the company codes or balance sheet accounts as additional account assignment.

April 2001 237 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Quantity Treatment Automatically Set Asset Value Date In the following posting transactions, you cannot enter an asset value date directly. The system therefore uses the default asset value date automatically. It determines which date it uses based on the table below: Goods receipt (valuated) Posting date Invoice receipt with reference to purchase order (valuated) Posting date of goods receipt (if in same FY, otherwise posting date) Invoice receipt without reference to purchase order (valuated) Posting date Invoice receipt (difference post.)

Depreciation Start Date The system determines the start period for depreciation calculation from the asset value date and the period control specified in the depreciation key (period control method) of the transaction category. The depreciation start date is the first day of the start period. The system determines the book value of an asset at the point of retirement In a similar fashion. Date Asset Is Ready for Operation Along with the date specifications already mentioned, you can also enter the date the asset is ready for operation in the asset master record (in the detail specifications of the depreciation areas).

Features For this purpose, you assign validation conditions to each transaction type group in FI-AA Customizing (Define validation). The system then checks against these conditions when you make a posting using this transaction type group. If the conditions are met, the system accepts the posting. If the conditions are not met, the system rejects the posting and outputs an error message. You specify this error message in the validation condition.

Postings that Cannot Be Reversed in Asset Accounting The following postings cannot be reversed in Asset Accounting.

When you set this indicator, you can create a posting that corresponds to the selected posting transaction, but has reversed positive/negative signs. This posting, however, has no relation to the original document. In addition, when you use this posting, the system newly calculates the proportional value adjustments in accordance with the asset value date of the posting. This is different from the procedure with an actual reversal. Reversal of the Settlement of an Asset under Construction There is a separate transaction (Posting → Capitalize Asset u. Const.) for reversing the settlement of an asset under construction. Enter the number of the asset under construction that was settled. The system then reverses all documents that were posted during the last settlement.

You manage the investments in the form of overhead cost orders or WBS (work breakdown structure) elements and an accompanying asset under construction. The orders or projects are the primary account assignment objects, and must be settled periodically to Asset Accounting. This kind of order or WBS element with its accompanying asset under construction is called an “investment measure.” When you use investment measures, all debits charged to the investment measure appear, at least temporarily, in cost accounting and in the profit and loss statement. This applies even if the debits actually will be capitalized to assets. The debits that require capitalization are cleared during the periodic settlement and charged to the asset under construction. In this way, the system enables you to manage both debits that will be capitalized and debits that will not be capitalized on one investment measure. The investment measure thereby has all of the functions of the asset under construction (such as, special depreciation, investment support measures). In addition, it has functions that are not available for assets under construction by themselves: • Settlement by cost element of costs that are not to be capitalized (using a source structure) • Settlement to the asset under construction, with different amounts to each depreciation area • Account assignment of activity allocation and overhead Capital investments that do not have an ‘under construction’ phase are usually capitalized directly in Asset Accounting.

However, you may want to manage cost accounting information at the same time. For instance, you may want to manage plan values, budgets and commitments in order to carry out target/actual comparisons. Features Therefore, the FI-AA component makes it possible to post asset transactions directly to assets, while it posts the transactions automatically as statistics to an internal order or a WBS (work breakdown structure) element. You define the order or WBS element as “statistical” by setting an indicator in the model order or the project profile (or directly in the master record of the order or WBS element). No settlement is possible for statistical orders or WBS elements. Their only purposes are planning and budget monitoring. Therefore, debits that are not eligible for capitalization (internal activity allocation), but that you wish to have reflected in the statistical budget, require special treatment. When you post this type of debit to the statistical order or WBS element, make sure that it also has an additional account assignment to CO (Controlling). The account assignment could be to a cost center, for example. By making this additional account assignment, you ensure that these costs are included in later CO settlements.

Active Budget Monitoring The system provides a passive availability check, which you carry out using reports. In addition, there is an active availability check, which enables you to prevent posting of transactions that would exceed the budget. The system checks the budget when certain transactions are entered. It determines if the available project budget or the available released budget is still sufficient.

When you have down payments or settlement from an order or WBS element to an asset, it is not possible to have automatic, statistical posting from the asset to a statistical order or WBS element. The reason is that down payment and settlement apply to assets under construction. Budget monitoring for assets under construction is handled in the Investment Measures part of the Investment Management (IM) component. Integration You can include statistical orders and WBS elements in the depreciation forecast (for more information, refer to Simulation [Page 531] and Simulation / Depreciation Forecast [Page 290]). The preconditions are that the order or WBS element • Has an investment profile in its master record (WBS elements: Details → Control data; orders: Investments).

April 2001 245 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Posting Gain/Loss Posting Gain/Loss Use When you post an asset retirement, you can enter the revenue from the sale of the asset. The system automatically determines the gain or loss (affecting income) as the difference between this revenue and the book value of the asset being retired. Since gain or loss from asset retirement does not occur regularly, they have only limited relevance for management accounting. Therefore the system posts gain or loss only as a statistic to the cost center. The actual account assignment to CO takes place to the profit center, which is assigned to the cost center (refer to Additional Account Assignment [Page 110]). Features Gain/loss from asset retirements and transfers requires special handling. You can make specifications for this in Customizing for Asset Accounting, in the definition of the retirement transaction types, per depreciation area (Customizing for Asset Accounting, choose Determine Posting Variants, Special treatment of retirement function). • Retirement with gain/loss (variant 0) When you use this variant, the system posts the difference between the revenue realized and the book value retired as gain/loss that influences the profit and loss account.

The system does not post any gain or loss. Instead it corrects the proportional value adjustments being retired by the amount of what would have been the gain or loss. There is no posting of gain/loss to the profit and loss account. Instead, the book value of the remaining part of the asset is increased or decreased by this amount. In this way, the affect on the profit and loss account is postponed from the year of the retirement to the years over which the asset is depreciated. If the revenue is more than the value adjustments being retired, the system treats the excess revenue as gain as it would in version 0. The system uses variant 0 for complete retirements here. • Revenue as a liability (variant 2) With this variant, the system does not post any APC or value adjustments being retired. Instead, the existing cumulative value adjustments are corrected by the amount of the revenue received. If the revenue is more than the existing cumulative value adjustments, the system treats the excess revenue as gain as it would in variant 0.

Account Assignment of Gain/Loss to Special Assets The standard setting is for the system to post gain or loss to the corresponding profit and loss account that is specified in the account determination. There is an indicator in the definition of the transaction type that allows you to change this setting. Gain/loss is then no longer posted to the profit and loss account. Instead, it is posted as write-ups to special assets that are solely for this gain/loss posting. You specify these assets in Customizing for Asset Accounting under Transactions in the following ways: • By entering a corresponding asset for each asset class • By defining a substitution rule, which the system can use to determine the assets (refer to Validation and Substitution [Page 226]). There is an indicator for the asset account assignment of gain/loss in the definition of the general transaction type. If this indicator is set, you can limit special retirement handling by depreciation area to variant 3 (gain/loss posted to special assets).

Retirement Revenue from Writing Off Special Reserves You can specify that the system includes retirement-related revenue from the write-off of special reserves in the calculation of gain/loss. You make this specification by entering the gain/loss accounts in the account determination for the depreciation areas for special reserves. If you do not enter any accounts there, the system posts the book depreciation gain and loss separately from the revenue from writing off special reserves. Posting Net Book Value You can specify that the system posts net book value from asset retirements to a clearing account for revenue from asset sale, or a clearing account for sales to an affiliated company. You make this specification in the definition of the asset company code. The system then does not post gain/loss (from sale) or loss (from scrapping) for an asset retirement.

Reporting during the year means that all transactions after the report date will be ignored and only the depreciation up to this date will be calculated. Therefore, it is possible to create an asset list with book values for the first quarter, for example. You can also request past years, providing they are still in the system. It is also possible to request future years. You can only use this function with the report date set at the end of a year. You then can select whether you want to see just the specified year under review or the annual values of all years up to the desired year under review.

Dynamic Selections The Dynamic selections function in the selection screen of the report enables you to narrow the selection of the report even further than the standard selections. You can use all the fields in the general part of the asset master record to limit the report. To do this, you select from the fields displayed (master data fields) in the resulting pop-up window, and choose them with the function Selections. In the screen that then appears, you can further limit the values for the report.

This total represents the cumulative value of all sub-numbers for the main number. The system will only create this kind of total if the asset has at least two sub- numbers. Sorting by Sub-Number Another indicator makes it possible to sort asset sub-numbers for each main number in descending numerical order. In this way, the system usually displays the most recently created sub-number first. Usable Tables (Fields) The fundamental rule is that you can only use fields from the asset itself in a sort version. In reporting, this means table ANLAV which contains the table ANLA, along with the fields of table ANLZ (time-dependent data). As of Release 2.2, you can also use table ANLP (posted depreciation). You can include values from table ANLV (insurance data) in the insurance list. For reasons of performance, it is not possible to use the supplier name in the definition of sort versions. • The sort version function is not available in standard reports that are based on ABAP query (see ABAP Queries [Page 275]). • It is not possible to use tables that deal with transactions (ANEK or ANEPV).

For more information about substitution, see Validation and Substitution [Page 226] Depreciation Forecast There is a separate standard report for the simulation of depreciation in future fiscal years. The date you enter for the report determines the future fiscal year up to which you want to simulate depreciation. For more information, see Simulation [Page 531] Simulation of Changes to the Value of Individual Assets You can use the transaction for displaying asset values to look at values for any fiscal years and fiscal year intervals. The system projects depreciation and values for future fiscal years based on the current values and depreciation terms. In this way, the system enables you to preview the course of future depreciation of the asset. In order to obtain a more in-depth analysis, you can simulate changes in the depreciation terms (useful life, depreciation key, depreciation start date, index). In addition, you can simulate any number of transactions directly in the value display transaction.

Basic Versions of the Asset History Sheet SAP provides country-specific versions of the asset history sheet, which satisfy the legal requirements of the given country. Additional history sheet versions are also available. Completeness When you create an asset history sheet, the system notes in the header of every screen whether the asset history sheet version was created using a complete or incomplete version. An asset history sheet version can be called \"complete\" when every transaction relevant to the history sheet, and - if they exist - every value adjustment which has been made to them, has been assigned to at least one position in the history sheet. Transactions relevant to the history sheet are the posting of acquisition and production costs, down payments, investment grants and write-ups. An asset history sheet version is only complete when: • Every transaction type relevant to the history sheet is assigned to a history sheet group. • The allocation indicator in column 1 to 5 is set (that is, contains either an X or a period) for every history sheet group except \"YA\", \"YY\" or \"YZ\".

The transaction type groups for the values below are relevant for the asset history sheet: • Acquisition and production costs • Down payments • Investment grants • Write-ups Every history sheet group contains 8 indicators. Each indicator represents a history sheet sub- group. By setting these indicators in the selected history sheet position, you specify that the value April 2001 271 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Definition of the Asset History Sheet fields associated with this group will flow into the selected history sheet position. You can see which value fields are represented in the history sheet sub-groups in the list that follows. History sheet sub-groups that are already allocated to a different (not the selected) history sheet position are identified with a period. By pressing F7=Info on the indicator, you can determine the history sheet position into which the transaction type sub-group flows.

For these reasons, assets under construction require special treatment during the legacy data transfer. Transfer of Line Items for Assets under Construction Assets under construction with line item management manage acquisitions over the course of a number of fiscal years as line items, without cumulating them. This is also reflected in the R/3 System. Therefore, you can enter transactions for this kind of asset under construction during the asset data transfer, even if the transfer date is the end of a fiscal year. You transfer line items that were posted in the current fiscal year using the usual transaction types for acquisitions (such as 100), when the transfer date is during the fiscal year. Line items that were acquired in previous fiscal years have to be transferred using the special transaction types for legacy data (900, 910).

When the transfer date is the end of the fiscal year, use the asset value date of 01/01/YYYY+1 (corresponding to a non-calendar fiscal year). For legacy data transfer during the fiscal year, the correct asset value date is the first day of the year in which the transfer date falls. Transfer of Down Payments on Assets under Construction If you are not implementing Asset Accounting and Accounts Payable at the same time, you have to transfer open down payments from your legacy system separately. The result of this procedure is, after the asset data transfer, there is no connection between the payables in Accounts Payable, and the capitalization of the asset under construction in Asset Accounting. Therefore, automatic clearing of the down payments posted to the asset is not possible. However, there are two ways to get around this limitation: • Accounts Payable was transferred before assets When you transfer down payments using the asset data transfer transaction in Asset Accounting, it creates line items only in Asset Accounting. You therefore have two choices: − Reversal of existing down payments before the asset data transfer Enter all down payments from fiscal years before the transfer year using the asset data transfer transaction in Asset Accounting (transaction type 910).

Post the down payments again, with account assignment to assets. The down payments from fiscal years before the transfer are then posted twice to the asset (once by the legacy data transfer and once by the explicit posting). Therefore, you need to post reversals for the same amount using transaction type 181. This duplicate posting and reversal are necessary, so that the system can later distinguish (at the settlement of the asset under construction) between down payments from the current fiscal year and from previous fiscal years. − Manual clearing on the assets side when posting the closing invoice April 2001 305 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Transfer of Assets under Construction This procedure applies when you have transferred the down payment in Asset Accounting using the normal legacy data transfer transaction, independently of Accounts Payable.

Subsequent Correction Postings to Reconciliation Accounts Suppose you have already defined the asset G/L accounts in Financial Accounting as reconciliation accounts, but still need to transfer balances to these accounts, or make corrections. You can make correction postings to these reconciliation accounts with a special posting transaction in Customizing for Asset Accounting (Transfer Balances), using posting key 40 or 50. You can only postings to those accounts in a company code with implementation status (Customizing for Asset Accounting, choose Preparing for Production Startup → Production Startup → Activate Company Code). Verification of the Reconciliation In order to verify the reconciliation of the balances of the asset G/L accounts and the asset subsidiary ledger, you use the balance list from Financial Accounting (RFSSLD00). From the viewpoint of Asset Accounting, the following standard reports can be used: • Asset balances: Asset list (RABEST01) • Balance of down payments made • Balance of accumulated depreciation • Balance of investment support • Balance of special reserves When the asset data transfer took place at the end of the fiscal year, start all of these reports using January 1 of the current year as the report date. (For a non-calendar fiscal year, use the first day of the fiscal year.) The system then supplies the cumulative values for the start of the fiscal year (that is, transactions from the current year are not included). For example, if the transfer date was December 31, YYYY, then start the reports using the report date January 1, YYYY+1. For a transfer during the fiscal year, you also have to reconcile the following profit and loss accounts using the following reports: • Expense accounts for depreciation April 2001 307 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Reconciliation of Balances with General Ledger • Allocation/write-off",

Special Considerations If SAP-FI Financial Accounting Is Already Active If your enterprise has already been using SAP R/3 Financial Accounting (FI) before the implementation of FI-AA, then all asset accounts and value adjustment accounts already have the correct status. Therefore, no balance transfer is necessary for G/L accounts. Up until the transfer date (the date that you chose as the cut-off point for the transfer of legacy data), you manage assets in your legacy system. At the same time, asset postings are made to Financial Accounting in the SAP FI System, and are managed in parallel in your legacy system. After the transfer date, and up to the date of the actual physical transfer, you cannot post any further asset transactions. Otherwise, there would be inconsistencies between the general ledger and the subsidiary ledger. The transactions that take place during time period B (refer to Time of Transfer [Page 301]) have to be posted at a later date, after the legacy data transfer. After the actual transfer of legacy data, you can create and post to new assets in the SAP R/3 System.

However, in some instances it may be necessary to transfer data from a legacy system into a live Asset Accounting company code. The reason is usually that all the data could not be transferred directly in the original transfer, because • Data was managed in a third system. • Company codes are to be fused. The first data transfer for company code 0001 took place on 12/31/98. The second data transfer for the same company code takes place in a subsequent fiscal year. There are two possible solutions in the R/3 System. Only the first of these solutions guarantees that the balances will be clear, correct and continuous in the R/3 System. Using the second solution, it is not possible to compare the initial balances in the asset history sheet in the year of the transfer (that is, the current year) with the final balances in the asset history sheet of the last fiscal year.

Maintaining the Continuity of Balances When you use this solution, you cannot transfer legacy data using the asset data transfer functions. Instead you have to post the applicable asset acquisitions in the current fiscal year. Subsequent Transfer without Continuity of Balances If it is not necessary for you to maintain the continuity of the account balances for closed fiscal years in the R/3 System, you can carry out the subsequent transfer using the asset data transfer function. Keep in mind: • You must close the fiscal years that came before the second data transfer. You cannot reopen these fiscal years under any circumstances. For a transfer at fiscal year end, this applies up to and including the year in which the second asset data transfer takes place (transfer date = 12/31/YYYY=> YYYY has to be closed).

Using the capitalization date, the system determines the depreciation start date and the expired useful life, based on the period control in the depreciation key. If the asset was acquired at a time when the company code had a different fiscal year variant, this determination of the useful life will be correct only if the period calendar assignments have been maintained historically. • The planned useful life is a required entry when a depreciation key for automatic depreciation calculation has been entered. You can also account for increased wear and tear on an asset in the past as the result of multiple shift use. You do this by manually correcting the expired useful life that was automatically calculated by the system. • Time-dependent data (such as the assignment to a cost center) can only be transferred with the values current on the transfer date. To create new time intervals, you have to use the function for changing master data. Asset Values Keep the following in mind when transferring values for assets from your previous system: You have to include all active depreciation areas for the asset and enter the historical acquisition costs. • • You can choose not to use automatic calculation of cumulative past depreciation (in Customizing for Asset Accounting, choose Asset Data Transfer → Parameters for Data Transfer → Options → Recalculate Depreciation for Previous Years [Ext.]).

In order to ensure that the data transfer is carried out correctly, you should adhere to the following guidelines when creating the Excel sheet: SAP recommends that you set the Standard Excel format for the entire document before you enter any data. Dates, however, can also be entered using the Custom Excel format. The Excel spreadsheet consists of two parts (see the example below). • In the header (blue in the example), you specify the type of data you want to transfer for your assets, for example, the company code, description, and so on. • In the asset section you enter the individual assets and their values. The Excel worksheet has to contain cells for the legacy asset number, company code, asset class and capitalization date, and values have to be supplied in these cells for each asset. The same applies for any required entry fields that are defined in the asset class in the R/3 System. You might want to prepare for the data transfer, although the organizational structures of your enterprise have not yet been specified (for example, the description of a company code is not decided). In this case, you enter variables for the missing information, for example, company code XXXX.

This organizational plan is used for employee management in the Personnel Development (PD) component. Features This organizational plan also plays a significant role in controlling SAP Business Workflow (see SAP Business Workflow (BC-BMT-WFM) [Ext.]. You need to define Asset Accounting and its employees (system users) in the R/3 organizational plan. These definitions are required for carrying out the following functions in FI-AA: Mass changes to master data • • Posting of mass retirement (see Mass Changes to Master Data [Page 538]) • Processing assets that were not created completely (see Master Data Maintenance with Asset Views [Page 218]) However, it is also possible to assign a Workflow task directly to an R/3 user (see the FI-AA Implementation Guide: Preparations for Production Startup).",

In this way, you can carry out the FI- AA standard tasks (such as mass changes) without having a defined PD organizational plan. Standard Tasks The tasks listed above are defined in SAP Business Workflow as standard tasks. In order to carry out these tasks, you have to define the organizational unit “Asset Accounting.” Then assign these standard tasks to this organizational unit, or to a plan position or position belonging to it. Graphic: Defining an Organizational Plan [Page 327] Procedure You can carry out the most elementary Workflow Customizing for FI-AA standard tasks in FI-AA Customizing under Preparations for Production Startup. For more information, see the FI-AA Implementation Guide. The following explains how, in addition to these settings, you can create the organizational unit “Asset Accounting” with the plan positions/employees belonging to it, and how to link them to the FI-AA standard tasks: 1. In the R/3 basic menu, choose Tools → Business Engineering → Business Workflow → Development → Definition tools → Organizational plan. 2. Enter the organizational unit that you want to assign to Asset Accounting (for example, “accounting”). Choose Continue. If there are no organizational plans maintained, you can create one via Organizational plan → Create. 3. Choose Create and enter a freely-definable key and a name for your organizational unit “Asset Accounting.” 4. Place the cursor on the new organizational unit and choose Staff assignments.

April 2001 327 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG System Performance Improvements System Performance Improvements Use There are a range of activities in Asset Accounting that require intensive system resources. You can improve performance for these activities considerably by taking certain steps. System performance is strongly influenced by the number of master records and depreciation areas being processed. The following formula can be used as a guideline: If the number of master records multiplied by the number of depreciation areas is more than 5 million, then SAP recommends that you use the options outlined below for improving performance. Features SAP’s general recommendation is that you should divide large datasets into a number of smaller files of equal size, and use multiple background processing jobs. The options for dividing large datasets into smaller portions is dependent on your hardware. If your CPU is already operating at capacity, then it is not possible to increase its speed further. Legacy Data Transfer • When you use external number assignment for the asset number, it is best to divide the assets by asset number. When you use internal number assignment for the asset number, it is preferable to divide the assets by asset class. In this case, you should combine asset classes that use the same number range. This way, the system does not run the jobs in sequence, rather than parallel, due to the number range. You should orient the number of files on the number",

This way, the system does not run the jobs in sequence, rather than parallel, due to the number range. You should orient the number of files on the number of application servers and the capacity of the CPU. However, make sure that you plan each of the jobs using a different system user, since the legacy data transfer program refers in part to user-dependent set/get parameters. • If you are transferring more than 10,000 legacy assets, you should use the direct data import RAALTD11. As compared to the batch input procedure (RAALTD01), direct data import improves performance by approximately ten times. (However, you should always use a small number of assets from each asset class for testing. Transfer these test assets using the batch input data transfer program, in order to make sure that the data in the input file is correct.) • Do not recalculate depreciation (this is very time-intensive). • The use of different fiscal year variants reduces performance. You avoid this by choosing a fiscal year variant that is not year-dependent, and switching over to the fiscal year variant you want once the legacy data transfer is complete. Reports Reports for the close of a period or the fiscal-year closing can usually be divided into several background jobs. Instead of running one report on several company codes, for example, it is much more efficient to plan several jobs, one for each company code, and have them run in parallel. It might also make sense to split up a report on one company code into several jobs. For example, a report by cost center can be divided into several reports, each with one cost center or cost",

If you nonetheless need this kind 328 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) System Performance Improvements of report, try not to choose the report date as a selection criteria. Performance is improved if you limit acquisition and retirement lists by the posting date instead, or limit asset balance lists using the capitalization date. • Avoid reports based on derived data, such as the profit center. Instead, select using data that is in the asset master record, for example the cost center. • Do not select using just one criteria, such as the account. Instead use combinations, for instance the asset class with the account group. • Select group totals. Periodic Processing • RASIMU: Divide the data manually, by cost centers, for example, or using an existing sort version. Determine the overall totals using download to Excel. • RABUCH: Process in parallel and post directly. • If you expect performance problems during depreciation posting (due to having over 100,000 assets), you can use a different program rather than the standard depreciation posting program RABUCH00.

Cost Planning You can speed up the transfer of planned depreciation to cost planning (see Primary Cost Planning [Page 526]) by planning for several jobs at once, instead of just one. For the individual jobs, you have to divide up your fixed assets (such as, by asset class or cost center). Mass Changes You make mass changes in Asset Accounting using R/3 Workflow and worklists (see Mass Changes [Page 228]). If you want to change more than 10% of all assets, you should create multiple worklists. The system can then process these worklists in parallel, making better use of system resources. Parallel Processing When carrying out the fiscal year change or recalculation of depreciation, you can distribute the transactions to several application servers.

Create a group asset (sub-number) for the respective vintage year, and assign all the appropriate assets to this group asset. (Refer to Group Assets [Page 53]). You also need to make the following settings in Customizing: • Specify the depreciation areas in which you want to manage group assets. The indicator for this is found in FI-AA Customizing under Valuation → Group Assets. If you choose to manage group assets as separate asset classes (with their own account allocation), you need to create these asset classes. Set the indicator in these asset classes that specifies they can only be used for group assets. • • Specify the accounting method to be used for asset retirements.

Generally, this reduction of the asset value is shown separately from the original acquisition and production costs, and is depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. Features In order to carry out the necessary tasks in the system, you can use the same functions that are used for showing investment support on the liabilities side of the balance sheet (see Special Valuation [Page 167]). These system functions make it possible for you to manage the reduction in value in a separate depreciation area, in which it can be depreciated. Define this depreciation area with the following characteristics (under Valuation): • Post assets in general ledger realtime • Management of positive and negative book values • Is not a derived depreciation area • Area type: “investment support on liabilities side” • No takeover of APC values from another depreciation area • Mandatory takeover of depreciation terms from area 01 If depreciation area 01 uses a depreciation key that depreciates the net book value over the remaining useful life, the value reduction will also be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. In that case, it is not necessary to change the remaining useful life manually. • Periodic posting of depreciation (under: Depreciation → Post depreciation to the general ledger). • Indicator set for “depreciation area manages investment support” (under Special Valuation → Investment support).

April 2001 333 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Tax Jurisdiction Code (USA) Tax Jurisdiction Code (USA) Use The tax jurisdiction code is used in the United States for determining tax rates. The tax jurisdiction code defines the tax authority to which taxes must be paid. The determining location is the location to which the asset was delivered. You enter this code in the asset master record under time-dependent data. Features When you post using a tax calculation table, the system enters the tax jurisdiction code in the FI document. For asset postings, the system determines the tax jurisdiction code based on the logic below: 1. It first looks for the tax jurisdiction code in the asset master record. 2. If it is not in the asset master record, the system takes the tax jurisdiction code from the cost center entered in the asset master record. 3. If neither the asset master record nor the cost center contain a tax jurisdiction code, the system takes the tax jurisdiction code from the company code to which the asset belongs.

For more information, see Fiscal Years and Periods for Asset Accounting [Page 90] Subsequent Changes to Period Control It is sometimes necessary, according to American financial reporting requirements, to use the mid-quarter convention. This convention might require you to change the control of the start of depreciation in the last quarter of the fiscal year, for acquisitions in the current fiscal year. If you change period control from mid-year to mid-quarter, you have to change to all assets that were created with the old depreciation start date. This can be done individually or using mass change.

For more information, see Preparations for Closing [Page 292]. There are two ways of reflecting the requirements of the mid-quarter convention in the system: • Depreciation key with time-dependent period control • Depreciation key and sub-number per acquisition year Depreciation key with time-dependent period control Set the Period control according to fiscal years indicator in the Customizing definition of the depreciation key you want to use (Depreciation → Valuation Methods → Period Control → Define Time-Dependent Period Controls). These keys then no longer use the period control of your depreciation key. Instead they use period controls that you specify, which are dependent on time and company code. You can define your own specific period controls for these depreciation keys • Per company code • Per fiscal year and • Per transaction type category • Change the time-dependent period control in these depreciation keys (in the application menu: Environment → Current Settings). • Start the program for the re-calculation of depreciation for the affected company codes. Note that the system uses an across-the-board treatment for retirements of the following years when you use this method. This means that the system does not check whether the asset acquisition was in a year that used the mid-quarter convention or in a year with normal period control.

Make the following settings: • Define a special mid-quarter depreciation key. Set the following: − In the depreciation key, set the Acquisition only in the capitalization year indicator. This ensures that the acquisitions in following years have to be managed on asset sub- numbers. As a result, the information about whether the acquisition year is a year with mid-quarter depreciation is not lost. − In the depreciation key (or in the period methods assigned to it), set period control for acquisitions and retirements at mid-quarter. • Manage a separate sub-number for each acquisition year. • Enter this special depreciation key in the asset main numbers and asset sub-numbers that were acquired in this year.

April 2001 339 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Deferred Depreciation (France) Deferred Depreciation (France) Use Tax regulations in France make it possible to defer the posting of some depreciation on all or a portion of assets belonging to the company, in a year with poor financial results. This means: • A portion of depreciation for this fiscal year, and possibly for subsequent fiscal years, is not posted if they close with a loss • The deferred amounts are accumulated on the asset. • The accumulated amount can be reversed in addition to the annual depreciation, if the enterprise closes the fiscal year with sufficient profit. Reversing the deferred depreciation means that you post this additional amount in addition to the normal depreciation. Features The law requires the enterprise to post at least a minimum depreciation each year, so that the cumulative depreciation posted per asset is not less than the theoretical value of the accumulated straight-line depreciation. The result of this requirement is that at least straight-line depreciation must be posted in each year. This means that you can only defer the posting of depreciation that exceeds the straight line depreciation. This amount is generally the difference between declining-balance and straight-line depreciation. This law requires reversing of deferred depreciation",

To meet this legal requirement, the system clears the deferred depreciation automatically, if you have defined a special derived depreciation area (see below). Required Depreciation Areas In order to meet the legal requirements described above, you need the following depreciation areas (FI-AA Customizing: Valuation → Depreciation Areas).

Automatic Reversal of Deferred Depreciation When you follow the specifications outlined above, depreciation area 10 controls the automatic deferral of depreciation. As soon as the net book value in depreciation area 10 becomes positive, the system reverses deferred depreciation in depreciation area 06 until a book value of at least zero is reached.

Enterprises that have locations in different municipalities have to supply this information per municipality. Features To meet these requirements, you must assign all fixed assets (not intangible assets) to a municipality. You can use the following master data fields: • Location (time-dependent data) The organizational unit “location” is primarily significant in the logistics components of the R/3 System. For your own information, and for reports you can assign each asset to a location. You define the characteristics of the location per plant (Customizing: Enterprise Structure → Maintain Structure → Definition → Logistics - General). The advantage of using this field is that it is time-dependent. Therefore, an asset can be assigned to different locations over the course of time. You can then easily keep track of changes in asset location. • Municipality (real estate specifications) This field is not linked to a Customizing table. You can make any entries in this field.

It does not influence the useful life of the asset. The acquisition and production costs can be completely depreciated by means of ordinary or extraordinary depreciation. You can also take investment incentive into account for partial production costs, if the production of the asset takes longer than 12 months (asset under construction). When determining profit, investment incentive amounts claimed are identified in the balance sheet in the form of reserves. If the asset is not retired before the fourth year, you have to clear the reserve as not affecting net income. If the asset is retired before the fourth year, you have to increase profit by the amount of the investment incentive.

Features You can represent an almost unlimited number of investment incentive amounts on asset master records. As a result, it is possible to represent the claiming of investment incentives over a number of years for partial production costs on an asset. In order to use this procedure, you have to set up a support measure for each year of support with the following data: • Period of validity • Percentage rate in relation to acquisition and production costs • Required period of retention • Base depreciation area, that manages the acquisition and production costs for determining the basis of the investment incentive • Support depreciation area, in which the investment incentive amount is managed You can post the investment incentive amounts, per depreciation area, to separate accounts. This means that you have to set up a separate depreciation area for every year in which you receive investment support. You have to create all the possible depreciation areas for managing investment incentives in the asset classes. When you maintain asset master data, the system then creates only those depreciation areas that the particular asset requires for investment incentives.

The report RAINZU01 is available for this purpose (menu: Periodic processing). Using this report, you can manage a number of percentage rates during the course of one fiscal year on one asset master record with one investment support key. Features Investment Support Claim Form for Assets The report identifies the investment support during the fiscal year for assets which contain at least one support measure in their master record. The report includes the transactions for the year. For measures that would have been eligible for investment support in the past, and for which you want to include previous year’s values, the cumulative values from previous fiscal years are included when determining the amount of investment support. The report determines the value based on the maximum percentage allowed in the Customizing definition of the investment support measure. If investment support has already been posted manually, the report determines the difference between the maximum allowed amount and the amount already posted. Mass Posting If you choose, the report will create a posting session for claiming the investment support.

Features To help you meet these requirements, SAP supplies the Declining multi-phase depreciation CZ depreciation calculation method. This depreciation calculation method determines depreciation using complex logic. In the first year of use, depreciation is calculated using the formula: “base value (e.g. net book value) / useful life” Starting with the second year of use, the system uses the formula: \"2 * base value / ((useful life + 1) - expired useful life) The Declining multi-phase depreciation CZ depreciation calculation method also uses a special depreciation logic when assets are modernized: This logic takes effect as soon as you post a subsequent acquisition using a particular transaction type to an asset that uses the Declining multi-phase depreciation CZ depreciation calculation method. The system then automatically sets the depreciation changeover year in the asset master record (in the detail screen for the depreciation areas), and changes the calculation formula for depreciation. The system uses this formula after the changeover: In the changeover year: 2 * base value / complete useful life (from depreciation start) After the changeover year: 2 * base value / (complete useful life - expired useful life starting from changeover) You control the setting of the changeover year using an indicator in the definition of the transaction type.

Deletion of Assets Without Postings or Old Assets You can delete an asset master record to which no postings have been made, directly online, without archiving. In addition, it is also possible to manually delete old assets (legacy assets from your previous system) during the asset data transfer process. Proceed as follows: • Delete all the transferred values for the old asset using the old asset change transaction. • Set the deactivation date for the old asset using the old asset change transaction (in the first master data screen) • Delete the old asset using the delete transaction (AS06). You can reset company codes that are in test status by using a special Customizing program (deletion of all application data). You find this program in FI-AA Customizing under Tools. Blocking Set the blocking indicator in the asset master record. Once the blocking indicator is set, you can no longer post acquisitions to this asset. The idea behind this, for example, is to prevent future postings to an asset under construction once the project is complete.

April 2001 371 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Acquisitions Acquisitions Purpose The primary business process in asset accounting is the purchase of assets and/or the capitalization of in-house produced goods or services. The Asset Accounting component supports various methods of handling this business process. Assets under Construction Assets under construction are acquisitions to fixed assets that are not permitted to be capitalized and depreciated immediately. The options below apply to direct capitalization: Collect the costs using an investment measure (an order or a work breakdown structure element with an asset under construction linked to it). For more information, see the documentation for the Investment Management (IM) component. • • Collect the costs on an independent asset under construction in the Asset Accounting (FI- AA) component. For more information, see Settlement of an Asset under Construction [Page 430] Direct Capitalization Direct capitalization refers to asset acquisitions that do not have an asset under construction phase. Instead, they are capitalized and begin depreciation immediately. The options below apply to direct capitalization: • – Direct account assignment to the final asset and possible statistical updating to an order or work breakdown structure (WBS) element. For more information, see External Asset Acquisitions [Page 373] – Processing Asset Acquisitions in Purchasing (FI-AA/MM) [Page 381] Goods Receipt and Invoice Receipt with Reference to Asset [Page 384] – • Account assignment to an order or WBS element (with allocation cost element) and settlement to the final asset (refer to Acquisition from Internal Activity [Page 388]) • Account assignment to a clearing account, and transfer from this account",

This means that you can post the asset acquisition and the corresponding vendor payable in one transaction. Using this transaction reduces the time and energy required for data entry and the possibility of discrepancies. Graphic: Acquisition Posted Using Integration [Page 375] Non-Integrated Asset Acquisition Posting You can post the acquisition of a purchased asset to a clearing account rather than using integrated posting to Accounts Payable. There are two scenarios: • The asset acquisition comes before the receipt of the invoice. The offsetting entry is posted automatically. As the acquisition amount, specify the actual net amount to be capitalized. Regardless of the document type (gross/net) which you use, the system does not deduct a discount here. • The asset acquisition is posted after the receipt of the invoice. You posted the invoice as an open item to a clearing account, and now you need to clear this entry. If the clearing account used is an open item account, when you post the acquisition, you can manually clear the posting to the clearing account (vendor invoice) at the same time (transfer with clearing). The corresponding transaction allows you to select all open items, per clearing account (account type S for General Ledger account) according to varying criteria.

You can then post the purchase order or the purchase requisition with account assignment to the asset. It is also possible to create fixed assets from within the transaction for creating the purchase order. This means that you can carry out both steps, “create asset” and “create purchase order or purchase requisition,” within one transaction. You enter the most important asset master data information in a dialog box . From this dialog box, you can go directly to the actual asset master data transaction. If the asset you create is incomplete because essential asset master data information is missing, the asset has to be completed later (refer to Processing Incomplete Assets [Page 54 ] 6 ). You can specify an asset class for each material group in Customizing (Transactions → Acquisitions ) to be used when you create fixed assets from the transaction for purchase orders or purchase requisitions. The system then provides this asset class as a default when you create assets for this material group. When you post the goods receipt or the invoice receipt, the system automatically capitalizes the asset. From an organizational perspective, it may be difficult to create an asset master record with the purchase order. There is therefore the option of creating a purchase requisition first, without account assignment. Then you enter the asset in the purchase order that results from the purchase requisition.

In this case, the asset is capitalized at the time of the invoice receipt.

In Customizing for Purchasing, choose Account Assignment → Maintain Account Assignment Categories. You can also maintain the control indicator in the detail screen of the purchase order item. It makes sense to post the goods receipt valuated, since the date of the goods receipt usually determines the moment the asset belongs to the fixed assets of the enterprise. Accounts When you post a valuated goods receipt, the system posts a debit to the asset and a credit to the ‘Goods receipt/invoice receipt’ clearing account. You have to set up this clearing account in Customizing (Financial Accounting → General Ledger Accounting → Business Transactions → Integration → Materials Management). This account is cleared when the invoice receipt is posted. When you post an unvaluated goods receipt, the system makes an integrated posting (debit to asset and credit to vendor). The system does not create any FI posting document in this case, only an MM document. Cash Discount During the payment run, differences may arise between the amount paid and the capitalization amount, because too little or too much cash discount was deducted.

April 2001 387 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Acquisition from Internal Activity Acquisition from Internal Activity Purpose An acquisition from internal activity is the capitalization of goods or activities that are partly or completely created within your own company. Process flow You are required to capitalize your own costs for such internal activity (for example, production orders or maintenance orders). There are two different approaches that you can use: • Capitalization of costs collected in a production order (when you manufacture an asset that requires capitalization within the framework of an internal production order) • Capitalization of costs collected in a maintenance order (for plant maintenance that requires capitalization, such as general",

As a prerequisite for this settlement, the settlement profile of the order must allow for receiver type “A” (for asset). You enter the settlement profile in the order type. It is copied from there into the individual order. You define settlement profiles in Customizing of the CO-OM (Overhead Controlling) component. Manual Direct Capitalization If there is no CO order in the system for the internal activity, you can manually post acquisition and production costs or maintenance costs to an asset. When you post in this way, the system posts to the same accounts as it does for a non-integrated purchase acquisition. The offsetting account for the APC account is also the clearing account “offsetting APC account ” in the FI-AA account determination. There is a special transaction type for acquisition from internal activity. This special transaction type makes it possible to distinguish between acquisitions from internal activity and other types of acquisitions in reports.

The value of these goods must then be capitalized to the respective asset. This is essentially a transfer from current assets to non-current assets. Process flow If you are using Asset Accounting in conjunction with the MM (Materials Management) component, you can post this business transaction using one system transaction. In this case, you have to create the goods movement in the corresponding warehouse (inventory management) using special transaction types for the account assignment to an asset.

Check whether the subsequent acquisition is to be posted to a new sub-number or to an already existing asset number. 2. Create a new sub-number or identify the asset to which you want to post. 3. Determine the asset value date for the posting. Remember that the asset value date determines the start of depreciation. 4. Post the subsequent acquisition using the appropriate transaction type (depending on the to depreciation areas to be posted: 020 - 115), and using an acquisition transaction (for example, Acquisition with vendor). 5. Check whether you need to revise the depreciation terms (for example, the useful life) for the asset. It may be necessary to change the depreciation terms, for example, if the subsequent acquisition has the character of a new asset, and therefore the calculation of depreciation has to be newly started. 6.

In this case, you have to transfer the asset to a new asset master record in order to ensure correct depreciation. The new asset master record must have the new remaining useful life as the planned total useful life. 398 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Manual Depreciation and Transferred Reserves Manual Depreciation and Transferred Reserves Use The following objects describe manual planning of depreciation and of transferred reserves.

You can generate manual depreciation amounts for all depreciation types, but it is more common to manually generate unplanned depreciation and the transfer of reserves. There are several different types of manual depreciation that can be differentiated according to the reason that manual depreciation is required: • There is an unexpected permanent reduction in the worth of the asset that you have to post as unplanned depreciation. • You have special tax depreciation that you only partially take into account. • You are using unit-of-production depreciation and want to manually plan depreciation, rather than using the depreciation key. Process Flow In order to forecast manual depreciation, you can use the standard posting transaction in Asset Accounting. The system provides special transaction types that enable you to forecast depreciation in relation to specific areas, or for all areas that use the corresponding depreciation type, in one stroke. Updating in the General Ledger The G/L accounts in Financial Accounting are not initially affected by this posting transaction. Asset line items are created, but no FI posting documents. The general ledger accounts are updated and the corresponding FI documents are created by the periodic depreciation posting run. The system then determines the depreciation to be posted up to a specific period, and creates the accompanying posting documents.

The system distributes manually planned depreciation to the remaining posting periods, regardless of the asset value date. Note that ordinary depreciation and special depreciation can only be posted manually if No automatic calculation is the depreciation method set in the base method of the depreciation key entered in the depreciation area. 400 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Manual Planning of Depreciation Correction of Unplanned Depreciation As soon as the reasons for the unplanned depreciation no longer exist, you normally have to reverse the effects of the unplanned depreciation. Therefore, we recommend that you use different transaction types for each type of reason you have for claiming unplanned depreciation. In order to make later correction of unplanned depreciation possible, you should set the Manage historic. indicator in the master record of the fixed asset concerned. Setting this indicator makes it possible later to select the posted depreciation by transaction type. You then post the correction of the unplanned depreciation by reversing the unplanned depreciation already posted (in the current fiscal year) or by posting a write-up (in following years).

The procedure is carried out in the following steps: • You sell assets, and post the resulting gain to the G/L account set up for reserves (allocation of the reserves). • You purchase assets to replace the assets that were sold. You transfer the reserve that was \"parked\" in the reserve account to the new assets. The reserve then reduces the basis for depreciation for the new assets, or",

Process Flow The Asset Accounting system does not yet explicitly support the allocation of reserves from gain on asset sales to a liabilities balance sheet account. You make this allocation of reserves manually in Financial Accounting. Since you are generally not allowed to balance the expense from allocated reserves with gain, the posting is usually a debit to the expense account from allocation of the reserves and a credit to the balance sheet account for allocated (transferable) reserves.

You determine, according to which depreciation area you post to, whether the transferred reserve should be handled as a reduction on the assets side, or as a value adjustment on the liabilities side (see Transferred Reserves [Page 189]). Process Flow When you post to Asset Accounting, the system initially creates asset line items only (with no posting documents). The actual posting of transferred reserves in Financial Accounting takes place automatically with the periodic running of the depreciation posting run. If you actively reduce the depreciation base in depreciation area 01, the posting will be a debit to the offsetting account for transfer of reserves and a credit to the value adjustment account for the transfer of reserves. Restrictions The legal restrictions in many countries forbid you (particularly when the allocation and the transfer take place in the same fiscal year) to balance out the revenue from the writing off of the allocated reserves and the expense from the transfer of the reserves to an asset. Therefore, you should not use the balance sheet account for allocated (transferable) reserves as the offsetting account for transferring reserves. This would correspond to a pure transfer within the balance sheet special reserves. Instead, you normally have to post to the corresponding expense account. Therefore, the revenue from the writing off of the transferred reserves must be posted separately and also be posted manually to Financial Accounting.

The report always determines the support amount according to the investment key as the largest possible percentage of the acquired APC or the down payments made, or as the maximum amount specified in the key. 412 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Posting Investment Support Report Output The following values are listed in detail: • Total calculated base value • Calculated base value for the current year • Total investment support amount posted • Investment support amount posted in the current year • Total investment support amount planned • Remaining support amount If you request a line item list, the report displays the following for each document: • Document number • Asset Value Date • Line item • Transaction Type • Posting amount The report creates totals per company code and investment support key.

Create a planning list for each investment support measure listing the assets that are eligible for support. Start the standard report (see below) using the test option (Periodic processing → Investment grant). Limit the report according to your requirements. It is especially important to enter the investment support key for the report. Start the report in the background (in the selection screen for the report: Program → Exec. in background). 2. Compare the planning list created by the system with your tax allowances. If necessary, correct the asset master records. Either delete the investment support key or change the Customizing definition of the investment support key. 3. If your planned investment support measures meet the approval of the tax authorities, you can initiate the collective posting of the investment support. – Start the Investment grant report without the test option. The report then creates the required posting session. – In the second page of the request screen for the report, enter the asset value date for the posting. 4. Process the batch input session (System → Services → Batch input). 5. Compare the account balance of the affected general ledger accounts with the totals identified in the list created. 414 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Posting Investment Support Manually Posting Investment Support Manually Procedure 1.

This revaluation is allowed at given intervals (usually several years). Collective Posting/Individual Posting The system can post the revaluation using collective posting. You can also manually revaluate individual assets. For this you use the standard posting transactions in the FI-AA component (Postings → Revaluat.(bal.sht.)).

Define the allowed revaluation and the depreciation areas that are to be used (FI-AA Customizing: Special Valuation → Revaluation of Fixed Assets). 2. Add the depreciation area to the asset classes, and maintain the depreciation terms (FI-AA Customizing: Valuation → Determine depreciation areas in the asset class).. 3. Define the index for revaluation. Use the SAP enhancement project ARVL0001 to define the index (refer to Management of Inflation [Page 175]). 4. Using the revaluation report, create a batch input session for posting the revaluation (Periodic processing → Post revaluation). In addition, the report creates a new depreciation area for all assets that are involved. This new depreciation area is the area in which revaluation is to be carried out, according to your specifications in Customizing. 5. Process the batch input session. The batch input session posts the revaluation for each asset in the appropriate depreciation area. 6. Document the revaluation (for example, in a long text in the depreciation area). 420 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Other Transactions During Life of an Asset Other Transactions During Life of an Asset Purpose The following objects describe business transactions that can take place during the life of a fixed asset.

April 2001 421 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Down Payments to Assets Under Construction Down Payments to Assets Under Construction Purpose Down payments represent a type of acquisition to fixed assets which you generally need to capitalize and report in a separate balance sheet item. For this reason, down payment postings use separate, special transaction types in the SAP R/3 System. Process flow The following transactions should be posted in connection with the down payment: • Creating a down payment request • Posting the down payment • Posting the corresponding closing invoice • Clearing the down payment with the closing invoice Posting to Accounts Payable The R/3 FI-AP (Accounts Payable) component has specific transactions that allow for posting to the corresponding assets. You post the down payment made to the reconciliation account for Asset Accounting (\"Capitalized down payments to assets\") as well as to the reconciliation account for Accounts Payable (\"Down payments made to assets\"). The offsetting account for the reconciliation account in Asset Accounting is a clearing account. In order to prevent down payments from being shown twice in the balance sheet, this clearing account must be linked to the same balance sheet item as the reconciliation account in Asset Accounting. When the closing invoice is received, it must be posted in full and capitalized to the asset. After this, you must clear the down payments with the closing invoice. When you clear the down payment, the system reverses the original acquisitions (the down payments) to the asset.

You can use the down payment request as a posting reference when you post the down payment manually. The payment program can also convert it automatically into a down payment posting. Down Payments Made You post the down payment made to the reconciliation account for Asset Accounting (\"Capitalized down payments to assets\") as well as to the reconciliation account for Accounts Payable (\"Down payments made to assets\"). The offsetting account for the reconciliation account in Asset Accounting is a clearing account.

Capitalizing Down Payments Without Closing Invoice If you want to start up an asset under construction at the year-end closing, you have to settle (transfer) the asset under construction to a capitalized asset. If the invoice receipt for a down payment does not take place in the same fiscal year as the down payment, you have to clear the open down payments already made first. They must be cleared with a forecasted invoice (reserve). The asset under construction can only be settled after this clearing. Capitalizing Down Payments Without a Closing Invoice [Page 42 ] 6 System Settings In order to post down payments to assets in the FI-AA component, you have to make the following system settings: • Enter the reconciliation account for down payments made in the appropriate account allocations. Also enter the offsetting account for Asset Accounting (FI-AA Customizing: Transactions → Acquisitions). The system posts to the G/L accounts entered under “acquisition down payment” and “offsetting account acquisition down payment.” • Allow posting with the transaction type group for down payments in the appropriate asset classes.

Initially, you post the down payment normally. If you then need to capitalize the asset under construction at the end of the fiscal year, but before the closing invoice is received, you post reserves for the total amount of the expected invoice.

April 2001 429 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Settlement of an Asset under Construction Settlement of an Asset under Construction Purpose An asset that you produce yourself has two stages in its life that are relevant for accounting from the point of view of your company: • Under construction phase • Useful life Generally, an asset has to be shown in different balance sheet items, depending on the phase that it is in. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the asset as a separate object or asset master record during the construction phase. The transition between these two phases is called \"capitalization of the asset under construction\" in the following. Process Flow You can manage the asset under construction in the system in two different ways, depending on the types of functions that you need. The asset under construction can be either a normal asset record, or a master record with line item management. As a result, the transfer from the asset under construction to completed fixed assets can be handled in one",

Using the IM component, you can manage a capital investment in parallel: for financial accounting purposes as an asset under construction, and for controlling purposes as an internal order or project. For more information, see the documentation for the Investment Management component. Assets under Construction Without Line Item Management The procedure corresponds to the procedure for the transfer between two assets within the same company code (see Posting the Splitting or Moving of an Asset [Page 450]). Before carrying out a full transfer of an asset under construction, you have to reverse any down payments that were posted in the current fiscal year. Down payments are ignored for a partial transfer. Special transaction types for the transfer of assets under construction allow for transfers to be displayed in the asset history sheet as acquisitions to fixed assets. 430 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Settlement of an Asset under Construction Acquis. date Amount 03/01/PY Capitalized asset 1650 550 TTy 348 AuC Acquisitions 300 07/12/PY 500 TTy 349 08/17/PY 700 12/13/PY 150 04/01/CY 200 04/12/CY 350 Intracompany Transfer of Asset under Construction Assets under Construction with Line Item Management In the FI-AA component, you can accumulate costs under purely technical aspects in an asset",

You do not need to consider the later creation of fixed assets at this point. During the construction phase, you can accumulate all acquisitions for an investment in a single asset. These acquisitions include • External activity (acquisition from vendor) • Internal activity (internal order) • Stock material (withdrawal from warehouse) in a single asset. When using this 'collective management' of assets under construction, it is possible to manage the individual acquisitions as open items over the course of several fiscal years. At completion, the line items must be cleared and then distributed to the various receivers. The system activates open item management when an asset under construction is created, if you set the corresponding indicator in the asset class. In addition, you have to assign a settlement profile to the company codes involved, in Customizing for Asset Accounting, in order for the line item settlement to work (see Define Settlement Profile in the Implementation Guide). The main function of the settlement profile is to specify the allowed receivers (such as, assets or cost centers). Graphic: Line Item Settlement [Page 434] Distribution Rules Line item settlement is carried out by using distribution rules. Distribution rules are asset-specific.

The investment support cannot be transferred to a completed asset, because you cannot tell if the investment support applies to acquisitions in the current fiscal year or earlier fiscal years. Therefore, you have to reverse the investment support manually before the settlement. After the settlement, you post it to the completed asset. Initiating the Settlement You can set up the settlement rules at a given point in time, and then carry out the corresponding update of the line items at a later point in time, since a separate transaction exists for the actual settlement. This transaction triggers the settlement posting for the selected assets under construction, and creates the necessary posting documents. During this process, the system automatically separates the transfer of asset acquisitions from prior fiscal years from acquisitions that took place in the year of capitalization. When the prior- year acquisitions are transferred, (special) depreciation and investment support measures are also transferred proportionally. The system automatically generates carryforward postings for partial capitalization. There is a standard report that enables you to trace the origin of the items in the capitalized asset back to the original asset under construction.

Therefore, it is possible to post the credit memo, as you do when you post an external acquisition, either integrated with a vendor, or to a clearing account (refer to External Asset Acquisitions [Page 37 ] 3 ). When credit memos are received for a fiscal year that is already closed, the system cannot correct the depreciation posted in the closed fiscal year. Therefore, you have to correct the depreciation for the closed fiscal year manually using a write-up before you can post the credit memo.

April 2001 439 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Post-Capitalization (Write-Up to APC) Post-Capitalization (Write-Up to APC) Purpose Post-capitalization, in this context, represents subsequent corrections to the acquisition and production costs of a fixed asset. An example of when you need this type of correction is if you neglected to add expenditures and costs linked with the acquisition or assembly of an asset to its APC in a fiscal year that is now closed. Process Flow The system posts gross post-capitalizations, meaning with historical depreciation amounts. The system newly calculates depreciation from closed fiscal years on the basis of the capitalization date entered in the asset master record. The system then posts the historical APC as an acquisition to the asset balance sheet account, and the accumulated depreciation from past fiscal years to the accumulated depreciation account. The system also posts extraordinary revenue in the amount of the difference between the APC and the accumulated depreciation. If you want to post net (enter the value adjustment manually), that is, you have already reduced the posting amount by the historical depreciation, you can use transaction ABNA to post without entering historical depreciation values. The system then posts the acquisition only in the amount of the net book value to the asset balance sheet account, and extraordinary revenue of the same amount.

This change can take different forms, depending on the reasons for the change. There are two common reasons for write-ups: • You forgot to capitalize an asset in a fiscal year that is now closed, and this omission must now be corrected (write-ups to APC are usually called post-capitalization). This procedure is described in detail in Post-Capitalization (Write-Up to APC) [Page 44 ] 0 . • The value adjustments (depreciation) that you calculated in the past were too high. You must now correct this error using a write-up in the current fiscal year. Excessive depreciation generally results from − The use of incorrect depreciation terms (incorrect expected useful life, incorrect depreciation key) − Unplanned depreciation, which is no longer valid in the current situation − A later reduction in the acquisition and production costs of an asset (for example, due to a subsequent credit memo) Process Flow Write-ups can be posted to: • Ordinary depreciation • Special depreciation • Unplanned depreciation • Manual depreciation • Transferred reserves Write-ups increase the book value of a fixed asset. When used with a depreciation method based on the net book value, write-ups increase the planned depreciation. During a fiscal year change, the write-ups posted up to the year-end are balanced",

When used with a depreciation method based on the net book value, write-ups increase the planned depreciation. During a fiscal year change, the write-ups posted up to the year-end are balanced with the depreciation amounts. Transaction Types The standard transaction types allow you to post write-ups to each of these depreciation types (transaction type group 7x). When you post the write-up, the transaction type determines whether all depreciation areas are affected or only some of the areas. Furthermore, there are transaction types that allow for simultaneous posting of write-ups to ordinary and special depreciation. You need to enter the correct accumulated depreciation account and the correct offsetting account for certain depreciation areas and depreciation types. This requirement applies to every area, for which asset values are posted automatically to the General Ledger, and for every depreciation type that these areas manage.

April 2001 445 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Intracompany and Intercompany Asset Transfer Intracompany and Intercompany Asset Transfer In Asset Accounting, SAP differentiates between two types of transfer, intracompany and intercompany asset transfer: • Intracompany asset transfer: a sending asset (or component of an asset) is transferred to a target asset within a single company code, for example, if the asset was created in the wrong asset class. • Intercompany asset transfer: a sending asset (or component of an asset) is transferred to a target asset",

You can post both of these types of transfer either automatically (retirement and acquisition posted in one step) or manually (retirement and acquisition posted in two separate steps). There are a number of Customizing settings that apply to both intercompany and to intracompany transfer transactions. 446 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Intracompany Asset Transfer Intracompany Asset Transfer Use Using intracompany asset transfer, you transfer a fixed asset, or an asset component, to a different asset master record. The target asset has to be in the same company code as the sending asset. Intracompany transfer may be necessary for one of the following reasons: • An asset was created in the wrong asset class. Since you cannot change the asset class in the asset master data, you have to transfer the asset to a new master record. You split up an asset or move part of an asset (transfer from asset to asset). • • You settle an asset under construction and transfer it to a finished asset. This procedure is described in detail in Settlement of an Asset under Construction [Page 430]. For information on intercompany asset transfer to a different company code within a corporate group, see Automatic Intercompany Transfer [Page 45 ] 3 .

Prerequisites You configure the transfer of capitalization and depreciation dates, as well as the transfer of field contents from the sending to the receiver asset, in Customizing for Asset Accounting. Intracompany transfers (within a company code) use transfer variants and field transfer rules, as do intercompany transfers. You find the Customizing steps for making these settings (for both types of transfer) by choosing Intercompany Asset Transfers → Automatic Intercompany Asset Transfers. Field Transfer The same conditions apply for both types of transfer (intracompany and intercompany) regarding field transfer and adopting specifications for capitalization and the depreciation start date. For more information, see Field Transfer [Page 46 ] 5 . Transaction Types and Transfer Variants SAP supplies standard transaction types for intracompany asset transfers. You can create additional transaction types or change existing ones in Customizing for Asset Accounting (choose Transactions → Transfers → Define Transaction Types for Transfers). SAP recommends that you create your own transaction types in the customer name range, using the standard transaction types as references. Avoid changing the standard transaction types themselves. For intracompany asset transfers, the system determines the transaction types from the transfer variant, the same as it does for intercompany (cross-company code) asset transfers. The system default for intracompany transfers is always transfer variant 4 (Transfer within a company code). However, you can change the transfer variant on the Additional details tab page. You define April 2001 447 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Intracompany Asset Transfer transfer variants, both for intracompany and intercompany transfers, in Customizing for Asset",

Choose Transactions → Intercompany Asset Transfers → Automatic Intercompany Asset Transfers → Define Transfer Variants. For more information, see Transfer Variant [Page 46 ] 2 . Depreciation Areas Transfer posting from one fixed asset to another within the same company code can be carried out in one step. The prerequisites, however, for automatic transfer posting are that no values (APC and depreciation) from the sending asset are lost, and that every area of the target asset is supplied with values. Below is a more detailed listing of what you need to fulfill these prerequisites: • Each depreciation area of the sending asset, for which the system determined a retirement amount, also has to be managed in the target asset. • Each non-dependent depreciation area in the target asset also has to be managed in the sending asset. • If ordinary depreciation is calculated for a depreciation area of the sending asset, the corresponding area in the target asset also has to calculate ordinary depreciation. The same applies for special depreciation. • The keys used for investment support measures must correspond in each depreciation area. The same applies to revaluation keys. If it is not possible to use automatic transfer posting because of these restrictions, you have to manually post a retirement and then an acquisition to carry out the transfer.

Features You can create a new asset within the transfer posting transaction, or you can transfer to an existing asset. The system enters the number of the sending asset in the target asset (on the Origin tab page). As with asset retirement, the intracompany transfer posting procedure distinguishes between prior-year asset acquisitions and current-year acquisitions. Full and partial transfer postings are possible. Full transfers can be posted in a single step (prior-year asset acquisitions and current- year acquisitions together). However, for partial transfers, you have to post prior-year acquisitions and current-year acquisitions separately. Partial transfers can posted by specifying a quantity, a percentage rate, or an amount (on the Partial transfer tab page). The system determines the amounts to be transferred and the proportional accumulated depreciation in the same way as for asset retirement posting. When you create an asset within the intracompany transfer transaction, you can only jump once to the dialog box for master data maintenance. (The same is true when creating an asset within the intercompany transfer transaction.) To change the master data of a new asset created in this way, you have to start the transaction again.

For the individual companies, an intercompany transfer represents a retirement for the one company and an acquisition for the other. From the point of view of the corporate group, however, it typically represents a transfer that balances to zero in the group asset history sheet For intracompany transfers (within one company code), use the Intracompany Asset Transfer [Page 447] function. An intercompany asset transfer within a corporate group may be necessary for one of the following reasons: • The physical location of the asset has changed, making it necessary to assign the asset to a new company code. • The organizational structure of the corporate group has changed, requiring you to reassign the asset to a different company code. Features It is not possible to change the organizational assignment of the asset by changing the asset master record. For each asset that you want to transfer, you have to create a new master record in the target company code, or you use an existing asset master record. The unique identity of the asset is preserved using the inventory number in the asset master record. There are three types of intercompany asset transfer: • It is a transfer within one client. You can post the retirement transfer and the acquisition transfer in one step (automatic intercompany transfer). • It is a transfer between two clients (automatic intercompany transfer).

For more information, see the ALE Scenarios in Asset Accounting topic. • If you do not have access to ALE functions, you can post a manual intercompany transfer in two separate steps as a retirement and an acquisition (no automatic intercompany transfer). When you post manual intercompany transfers, the posting can be integrated with accounts payable and accounts receivable, which is not the case when you use the automatic intercompany transfer. Reversal Function You can reverse automatic intercompany asset transfers, like other postings, using the normal reversal functions in Asset Accounting. The system then reverses the retirement document in the sending company code and the acquisition document in the target company code. If a new asset April 2001 451 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Intercompany Asset Transfer (Between Company Codes) was created in the target company code, you can block the asset to any additional acquisition postings.

You have to enter the transaction types accordingly. • Which transfer method (gross, net, new value) should be used for posting? By using cross- system depreciation areas, you can specify a separate transfer method for each depreciation area. • Do the sending and target company codes have different charts of depreciation?

The same applies if one or both of the company codes is not assigned to a company ID. The company (company ID) is an organizational unit in accounting that allows you to organize your enterprise to meet certain legal requirements. To create your own company code relationship types, you can use customer enhancement AMSP0002. For more information, see the documentation on customer enhancements (transaction SMOD), and Customer Enhancements (Customer Exits) [Page 35 ] 9 . In the standard system, SAP assumes that transfers within the organizational unit company (relationship type 02) are treated as intracompany transfers and posting takes place using the gross method and intracompany transfer transaction types. Intercompany asset transfers between company IDs (relationship type 01), on the other hand, can be posted using the gross, net or new value method using retirement and acquisition transaction types. For more information, see Transfer Variants [Page 462] and the examples for intercompany asset transfer.

Use When you transfer assets between company codes, the two company codes might not use the same chart of depreciation. Nonetheless, there could be depreciation areas in the two charts of depreciation that actually have the same function, although they have different keys. Cross- system depreciation areas are used to control the transfer of values during intercompany asset transfer. By defining cross-system depreciation areas in Customizing for Asset Accounting, you ensure the unique assignment to one another of depreciation areas with the same function. You assign depreciation areas from different charts of depreciation, but that have the same function, to the same cross-system depreciation area. This assignment provides all of these depreciation areas with one key that is valid in all clients, but is at the same time independent of the key of the depreciation area in its local client. In most cases, you do not need cross-system depreciation areas. You need them only in the following situations: • You use different charts of depreciation, but the function of certain depreciation areas is the same. • There is one depreciation area that you do not want to transfer. Then do not assign that area to a cross-system depreciation area. • Some depreciation areas have the same key, but have different functions.

Integration If you make use of cross-system depreciation areas, you have to create cross-system depreciation areas explicitly for all depreciation areas that are transferred. This applies even if you only actually need the cross-system depreciation area for one depreciation area, and all other local depreciation areas (with identical functions) have the same keys. Assign the necessary local depreciation areas to the cross-system depreciation areas for all charts of depreciation you use. To do so, you have to temporarily change the chart of depreciation when customizing cross-system depreciation areas. Defining cross-system depreciation areas affects the transfer of values only. Cross-system depreciation areas have no influence on the creation of depreciation areas on the target asset.

Integration Company Code Relationship and Transfer Method In the standard system, SAP assumes that transfers within the company organizational unit (relationship 02) are treated as intracompany transfers and the posting is gross. Therefore intracompany transfer transaction types are used. Gross transfer should always be posted without revenue. Company codes that belong to the same company are not legally independent entities and do not draw up their own external financial statements. The company (company ID) is the smallest organizational unit for which individual financial statements are required according to the relevant commercial law. SAP does not supply any transfer variants that allow asset transfers within a company using the net method or the new value method.

This removal of an asset (or part of an asset) is posted from a bookkeeping perspective as an asset retirement. Depending on organizational considerations, or the business transaction which leads to the retirement, you can distinguish the following types of retirement: • An asset is sold, resulting in revenue being earned.

Sale Scrapping Retirement with customer without customer Asset Retirement Asset Sale with Customer The system enables you to post the entry to Accounts Receivable, the revenue posting and the asset retirement in one step. In this posting transaction, you have to post the revenue (debit A/R, 484 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Manual Posting of Intercompany Asset Transfer/Acquisition credit revenue from asset sale) first, and then post the asset retirement. An indicator in the posting transaction specifies that the system posts the asset retirement after the revenue posting.

You define the field status variant in Customizing for Financial Accounting (Financial Accounting Global Settings → Document → Line Item → Controls).

You can also choose not to set this indicator, in which case you have to enter the postings manually. For more information on ways of posting gain and loss, see . Posting Gain/Loss [Page 246] Retirement Without Revenue A retirement without revenue is the removal of an asset from the asset portfolio without any revenue, for example, by scrapping.

Complete/Partial Retirement An asset retirement can refer to an entire fixed asset (complete retirement) or part of a fixed asset (partial retirement). In both cases, the system automatically determines, using the asset retirement dates entered, the amounts to be charged off for each depreciation area. You can initiate the partial retirement of a fixed asset by entering one of the following: • The amount of the acquisition and production costs being retired • A percentage rate • A quantity The asset value date of the retirement is recorded in the asset master record.

After posting the belated transaction, you can then re-post the retirements. When you enter the amount of APC that is being retired, the system determines the percentage to be retired from the asset using the first depreciation area in which posting is to take place. It determines the percentage amount of APC being retired in that area, and uses the same percentage for other areas. You can enter a quantity, provided that you have not specified a retirement amount or percentage rate. The system interprets the quantity as a ratio to the total quantity of the asset and thereby determines the asset retirement percentage rate. If necessary, you can also manually correct the retirement amounts that were calculated by the system in individual depreciation areas.

Proportional Value Adjustments Based on the value date and period control, the system automatically determines the reference period for the retirement. The system automatically determines any depreciation (value adjustments) that is applicable to the part of the asset being retired, up to the reference period (retirement). The system automatically retires this depreciation at the time of the retirement transaction. This procedure guarantees that the percentage of the book value that is retired is identical with the percentage of the acquisition and production costs that is retired. Graphic: Determining Proportional Value Adjustments [Page 488] The system automatically posts the proportional value adjustments retired during an asset retirement. You can specify special transaction types for this automatic posting. You enter these transaction types in the Customizing definition of the retirement or transfer transaction types (Value adjustments function). These special transaction types for the proportional value adjustments are particularly important for group consolidations, so that the individual transaction can be identified as retirement of transfer. The standard transaction types delivered by SAP are already defined in this way. The system uses the transaction type 290 for proportional values with retirements. For transfers it uses transaction types 390/395 (transfer retirement/acquisition). Retirement of Low Value Assets There are special considerations for the retirement of low value assets (LVAs).

Retiring Several Asset Sub-Numbers Simultaneously The system enables you to post the complete retirement of several sub-numbers of a fixed asset in one step (generic entry using an asterisk (*) in the sub-number field). The system performs asset postings and value adjustment postings for each sub-number.

In this case, you may have to reverse the negative transaction as well, since the net book value of the asset could become negative after the first reversal. Reversal Indicator Along with the special reversal transaction, the initial screen of the FI-AA posting transaction also offers a reversal indicator. When you set this indicator, you can create a posting that corresponds to the selected posting transaction, but has reversed positive/negative signs. This posting, however, has no relation to the original document. In addition, when you use this posting, the system newly calculates the proportional value adjustments in accordance with the asset value date of the posting.

April 2001 499 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Posting Depreciation Posting Depreciation Purpose Every asset transaction in the R/3 Asset Accounting (FI-AA )component immediately causes a change of the forecasted depreciation. However, it does not immediately cause an update of the depreciation and value adjustment accounts for the balance sheet and profit and loss statements. The planned depreciation is posted to the general ledger when you run the periodic depreciation posting run. This posting run uses a batch input session to post the planned depreciation for each posting level for each individual asset as a lump sum amount. Process Flow The calculation and scheduling of depreciation, interest and revaluation are automatically controlled by keys in the system, or you can control them manually using a special posting transaction. In both cases, planned depreciation from Asset Accounting must be periodically posted to the corresponding asset and expense accounts of the general ledger.

The parameters for starting the report are described below. Posting Period For planned posting runs, the periods are posted in chronological order according to the specified posting cycle. As long as the last normal period was already posted, it is possible to post to special periods in Financial Accounting. This is generally required, when certain measures for the year-end closing (regarding accounting policy) should be kept from distorting the results for the last normal period. Start a planned posting run by entering any special period (for example, 13). When you have a non-calendar fiscal year, you still have to enter the FI period to be posted, rather than the calendar period. For more information, see System Settings for Posting Depreciation [Page 118]. Purpose of the Posting Run You can choose the following activities during each posting run by setting certain parameters in the initial screen: • Next planned posting run You post to the next period that is specified according to the posting cycle. During a regular posting run of this kind, the system does not allow for limiting the run to particular assets. • Repeat posting run You can request a repeat posting run for the last period posted.

During a repeat posting run, the system only posts the differences that resulted between the first posting run and the repeat posting run (=> no double posting). You can limit the run to particular assets. Take note of the following special considerations related to the posting process (use of catch-up or smoothing) when you make a repeat run (refer to System Settings for Posting Depreciation [Page 118]). April 2001 501 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Posting Depreciation − Catch-up method When you use the catch-up method, the system calculates depreciation over again from the start of the year (or depreciation start) up to and including the depreciation period you are now posting. The difference between this amount and the total depreciation already posted is the new depreciation amount that is posted in the case of a repeat run. As a result of this recalculation of depreciation, new postings and changed depreciation parameters are included in the repeat run. − Smoothing When you use the smoothing method, the annual depreciation that is still to be posted is distributed evenly over the periods that have not yet been posted. There is no recalculation of depreciation, as there is when the catch-up method is used. Once a period is posted, there can be no new posting to the same period. Any changes to depreciation terms, and/or any new acquisition postings, become effective only in the following period. The only exception is when a new asset is created.

Using the restart mode ensures that all system activities that were interrupted by the termination are repeated • Unplanned posting run If, for certain reasons, you want to skip over one or more posting periods, specify an unplanned posting run. The system then creates a posting session for all periods which were skipped, as well as for the period entered. The posting period which you specify, however, must fit into the posting cycle. If you specify period 7, for example, for a quarterly posting cycle, no posting will occur. Individual List/Test Run In addition to the batch input session, the report provides a list of depreciation. This list shows the planned depreciation for the year, the depreciation which has been posted up to this period, and the depreciation to be posted in this period, for each account group and depreciation area (and, if desired, for each asset). Correlation of the list and the posting documents is aided by the inclusion of the internally assigned document numbers in the list. In order to ensure that all assets are processed within a posting period, you can limit the report to certain assets only during a repeat run.

The causes of these errors and methods for handling them are outlined below. Checks During the Posting Run After the start of the posting program, the system carries out various checks: • First the system checks the posting period that has been entered. For a regular posting run, the posting period must follow the last posting period in chronological order. • Then the system runs a plausibility check on the depreciation amounts to be posted.

If an error is discovered, this does not lead to a termination of the posting program. The system continues to create the batch input session, and lists the assets with errors, along with the cause of the error, in the report log. The depreciation amounts for the assets with errors are not included in the batch input session. Check the values for the assets with errors in the asset value display transaction and make the necessary corrections. You can post the depreciation for these assets to Financial Accounting, either through a repeat run or in the next planned depreciation posting run. • Another important check criterion is the existence of the G/L accounts to be posted. If the system finds a G/L account that is not defined, it terminates processing. You must then first complete the account definitions. Then you have to restart the program using the restart option. Termination While the Posting Session is Being Created The posting program may terminate while creating the posting session, because, for example, it came to an account that was not defined.

The Batch Input Session is Destroyed (Recreate Session) If errors cause a termination of the batch input session while it is processing, or if the session is accidentally deleted, you can recreate the batch input session (Periodic processing → Depreciation run → Recreate session). In this case, the system only recreates those documents that were not already posted. That is, the recreation takes into account the fact that the posting session may have partially been processed before the termination. April 2001 505 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Handling of Errors During Depreciation Posting The prerequisite for the correct restart or recreation of a session is, however, that you have not made any Customizing changes in the meantime to the depreciation posting rules or the number range for the depreciation document type. Furthermore, you cannot have made any changes to any additional account assignments in the asset master record (such as order or cost center).

These changes consist of all postings that affect the APC of the asset, including acquisitions, retirements, and so on. You need to post changes to asset balance sheet values from more than one depreciation area to the general ledger, if one of the following applies: • You need to create different balance sheet versions, for example, for internal and external purposes. You can define any number of balance sheet versions per chart of accounts in FI (General Ledger) for this purpose. • You have a group depreciation area in a foreign currency, and you need to post changes to asset balance sheet values from this area to the ledger of the corporate group (see below). • You calculate special reserves for special depreciation in a derived depreciation area. (This is common in Germany in depreciation area 03 of the standard chart of depreciation.) Process Flow At the present time, online automatic posting to Financial Accounting is only possible for one depreciation area. It is therefore necessary that changes to asset balance sheet values (transactions) from other depreciation areas be posted to the respective G/L accounts on a periodic basis.

When the Post assets periodically to General Ledger indicator is set in the definition of the depreciation area, this batch input session posts all changes to asset values (APC) from these depreciation areas to the respective G/L accounts. When you process the batch input session created, the system posts the APC transactions to the accounts in the account determination of the depreciation area. The report generates one document for each month. This document has a line item for each account or business area.

In the report selection screen, choose Program → Execute in background. The accounts for parallel valuation are not permitted to be reconciliation accounts. Corporate Group Ledger The system always uses the consolidation transaction type from the originally used transaction type when both of the following apply: the system is posting a transaction affecting APC values and this transaction is from a depreciation area for parallel valuation that is posted periodically to the general ledger. The system requires the posting amount both in the foreign currency and in the local currency for the group consolidation. Therefore, for APC postings, the system posts the amount in group currency from the group depreciation area to the corporate group ledger, in addition to the amount in the local currency from the group depreciation area managed in local currency. For more information, see Requirements for Consolidation [Page 206] Special Reserves There are also derived depreciation areas that do not manage acquisition and production costs, but that are used for creating special reserves (for example, area 03 special tax depreciation for Germany). These depreciation areas also have to be posted periodically as parallel valuation. For these derived areas, the program posts the proportional value adjustments resulting from retirements, transfers, post-capitalization, and so on. 508 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Parallel Valuation An asset has the depreciation areas",

The FI-AA component provides the following functions to support the physical inventory: Process Flow Inventory list The system provides an inventory list to assist with physical inventory. You find this list in the standard Information System for Asset Accounting. You adapt the structure and sorting of the list to meet your specific needs. You make these modifications using standard ABAP Query (see ABAP Query [Page 275]). The list displays only those assets in which the inventory indicator is set in the asset master record, Barcode There is an additional report that enables you to print selected information from the asset master record together with a bar code. It is printed using a freely-definable SAPscript form. You can use the printout for labeling assets for individual identification. The barcode is unique for each asset, since it represents (in the standard system) the asset main number and sub-number. SAP provides the standard form (formerly called layout set) FIAA_0003. You can use this form, or use a copy of it as the basis for defining your own form (see the Implementation Guide: Information System → Define/assign layout sets). The standard form contains the following text elements: • Asset description • Cost center of the asset • Inventory number • Asset main number and sub-number • Barcode Along with this master record information, you can use all fields",

You can also have any fields in table ANLAV appear as barcode. If you want to have the inventory number as barcode, rather than the asset main and sub-number, replace this line in the standard form <BC>&ANLAV-ANLN1&-&ANLAV-ANLN2&</> with the line <BC>&ANLAV-INVNR&</>. Barcode Format Various barcode formats are available in the SAP System (such as EAN 13). The standard form is set for the format BC_CD39C. This format allows the barcode conversion of all alpha-numeric characters and the hyphen (no other special symbols). April 2001 513 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Physical Inventory In order to change the barcode format (for example, to one with 128 codable characters), you have to change the character string <BC>. You make this change in the transaction for maintaining forms: Change text elements. Size of the Label You can also determine the size of the label: Proceed as follows: 1. Choose Change windows in the transaction for form maintenance. 2. Choose Edit → Main windows. 3. Enter the number of labels you want in each row and column on each page (print area). The system then automatically creates the right size windows for the form. It uses the page format that is specified in the form header (such as 8 1/2 by 11).

Interfaces to Non-SAP Systems There are various interfaces you can use to link inventory software to the SAP R/3 system (refer to Inventory Interface for Non-SAP Systems [Page 516]). This interfaces are particularly useful for returning inventory data, which was gathered using non-SAP software, to the R/3 System. 514 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Generating the Inventory List Generating the Inventory List Procedure 1. Specify the scope of the inventory: Determine the company codes, plants, locations, and so on, in which the inventory should take place. Determine the employees who are to carry out the physical inventory. 2. Create inventory lists (Info system → Report selection → Asset portfolio) and distribute them to the employees carrying out the inventory: – Define a sort version that contains the relevant master data fields (for example, inventory indicator, location, room) as sort criteria. – Start the inventory list using this sort version. 3. Process the results of the inventory: – If an asset is missing, post a retirement. If an asset is found, post an asset acquisition. – For assets that have changed location, change the asset master record (for example, the location). 4. Enter the inventory date in the affected assets.

The interfaces allow you • To transfer the current asset inventory data from the R/3 System to non-SAP software • To import the data from the physical inventory back into the R/3 System, and trigger any necessary postings The procedure for carrying out your inventory with the help of non-SAP software could look like this: 1. First the non-SAP system receives an overview of the fixed assets in the R/3 System. It gets this overview by calling the BAPI BAPI_FIXEDASSET_GETLIST, which provides information on all fixed assets managed in one company code in the R/3 System, or a subset thereof (for example, all fixed assets at a given location). 2. Then you carry out the inventory using the non-SAP system. Depending on the various possible results of the inventory, there are several possible scenarios: – The inventory results match the fixed assets data from the R/3 System. If this is the case, you can use the BAPI called BAPI_FIXEDASSET_CHANGE to update the inventory date in the asset master record. – The results of the inventory are not the same as in the R/3 System. For example, an asset is at a location different from the one stored in the R/3 System. If this is the case, you can use the BAPI called BAPI_FIXEDASSET_CHANGE in order to make the necessary changes (for example, to change the location) in the asset master record. – The inventory does not find the fixed asset.

Using the BAPI called BAPI_FIXEDASSET_CREATE you can create fixed assets in the R/3 System. After creating the asset, you can use the BAPI called BAPI_ASSET_ACQUISITION_POST to post the asset acquisition, or BAPI_ASSET_POSTCAP_POST to post a post-capitalization. For each BAPI that creates a posting (acquisition, post-capitalization or retirement), there is a corresponding BAPI that carries out all of the same checks as for the posting, but does not create a document. One example is BAPI_ASSET_ACQUISITION_CHECK. You can use these check BAPIs to find incorrect postings before they are imported into the R/3 System. For more information on the specifications for the interfaces for these BAPIs, see the documentation for their function modules. Also note that the use of these BAPIs is not restricted to use related to physical inventories. The same BAPIs can be used for other reasons in order to link Asset Accounting to non-SAP Systems. 516 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Inventory Interface for Non-SAP Systems April 2001 517 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Fiscal Year Change Fiscal Year Change Purpose From the point of view of the system, a fiscal year change is the opening of a new fiscal year for a company code.

You find the fiscal year change program under Periodic processing. Process flow The fiscal year change can only be carried out (even in test mode) for the new fiscal year. The earliest that you can carry out a fiscal year change is in the last month of the old fiscal year. You can choose any point in the new fiscal year for carrying out the fiscal year change. Before you can change to fiscal year YYYY, you must have already closed fiscal year YYYY - 2 (refer to Year-End Closing [Page 520]). You can have a maximum of two fiscal years open for posting at one time. No business transactions can be posted in a new fiscal year before the fiscal year change.

Process Flow You use the year-end closing program to close the fiscal year for one or more company codes from an accounting perspective. Once the fiscal year is closed, you can no longer post or change values within Asset Accounting (for example, by recalculating depreciation).

Either you now receive an error message with additional long text explanations, or the error is corrected by the recalculation. When the error has been corrected, it is possible that planned depreciation values could have changed. Therefore, carry out another depreciation posting run (repeat run or posting to special periods - refer to Periodic Posting of Depreciation [Page 503]).

The Capitalization Date was not Set If the capitalization date was not set, check if all asset classes for assets under construction have been entered correctly in the initial screen of the year-end closing transaction. It is normal that assets under construction are not capitalized. When you enter the asset classes for assets under construction in the initial screen, these assets are exempted from the check to see if assets are capitalized. If the assets with this error are not assets under construction, set the capitalization date manually in their master records. Then carry out a depreciation posting run. Errors in Updating the Base Insurable Value The problem here is usually missing index figures for the fiscal year that is being closed. Maintain the missing index figures (see Defining Index Series [Page 418]). Go to master data maintenance for the asset. Go to the screen for the insurance data and choose the fiscal year change function. If you receive an error message, see the long text for more information.

For more information, see Processing Incomplete Assets [Page 546] April 2001 525 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Primary Cost Planning Primary Cost Planning Purpose For primary cost planning related to cost center accounting, you need to forecast future depreciation. Therefore, you can determine planned periodic depreciation and interest for any Asset Accounting depreciation area. The depreciation area has to be a real depreciation area, not a derived depreciation area. Using a special report (Periodic Processing), you can transfer this depreciation and interest to the Controlling (CO) component. There is an indicator in the report request screen you use to specify if planning should take place on cost centers or on orders. Process Flow The way the system determines planned depreciation for this purpose is similar to the way it simulates depreciation. For more information, see Depreciation Forecast [Ext.] and Depreciation Forecast with Planned Investments [Ext.] and APC Values for Planned Investments [Ext.].

When you run the report in update mode and it is not possible for the report to transfer certain values, the report terminates and issues an error message. After you correct the error, you can restart the report for the original dataset. This does not present a problem, since the plan values that were already transferred are now overwritten (rather than being added to). Planned Investments If you are using the Investment Management (IM) or Overhead Orders (CO-OPA) and Project System (PS) components, you can also include the simulated depreciation and interest derived from the planned values of investment measures and investment program positions, in addition to those of capitalized assets, in primary cost planning. You can choose whether the system uses the budgeted values or plan values as the APC for planned capital investments. You make this specification when you start the report. When the simulation is based on plan values, you can also specify the plan version to be used. In order to carry out primary cost planning with planned investments, the requirements below must be met: • Depreciation simulation data has to be entered in the master data of the order or WBS element or investment program position (master data maintenance is found under Extras). • The planned investment has to have budget or plan values.

The system does not normally adjust these values for orders or WBS elements when part of the planned investment has already been capitalized (that is, settled to capitalized assets). For a depreciation simulation that includes capitalized assets and planned investments at the same time, this could cause problems. The system would include the plan or budget values from the 526 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Primary Cost Planning order or WBS element along with the values from the capitalized asset. As a result, the already capitalized values would be duplicated. In order to prevent duplications, there are two options in the initial screen of the depreciation simulation for handling capitalizations in the current fiscal year: • The report ignores the capitalization postings in the current year. As a result the simulation is always based on the asset balance sheet values at the start of the current fiscal year. • The report excludes capitalization that has already been posted for orders and WBS elements.

April 2001 527 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Primary Cost Planning Distribution Key If you specify a distribution key when starting the report, values are determined based on the time period specified in the from/to period. The values are then distributed according to the distribution key to the individual periods. If you do not enter a distribution key, the system determines the values individually for each period in the specified planning interval. Separation of Fixed and Variable Costs It is basically possible to separate the depreciation of assets into fixed and variable portions (refer to Depreciation for Multiple-Shift Operation and Shutdown [Page 160]). This separation is also recognized in primary cost planning. The report calculates the pure fixed cost portion along with the total costs. The variable costs are determined, according to the definition, as the difference between these two values. However, the system only calculates fixed costs separately if the following requirements are met: • You must have requested activity-type dependent planning. • There has to be an activity type and a multiple shift factor specified in the asset master record. If the asset is not used in multiple shifts, you have to set a multiple shift factor of 1. • The planning parameter that is entered must specify manual fixed cost planning that is activity type-dependent.

Changing the Cost Center in the Asset Master Record The assignment of the asset to a cost center may change during the fiscal year. When this happens, the system recognizes the period in which the change took place. The following should be kept in mind: • The change of cost center has to take place at the end of one period or the beginning of the next. • There are special considerations if primary cost planning takes place using a distribution key. You then have to sub-divide the period interval into smaller intervals, so that the change of cost center is always at the start of one of these smaller intervals. Start a separate primary cost planning run for each sub-interval. You want to plan for an entire fiscal year for periods 1 to 12. Changes to the cost center took place on April 1 and October 1. If you enter a distribution key when starting primary cost planning, you have to carry out three primary cost planning runs: • For periods 1 to 3 • For periods 4 to 9 • For periods 10 to 12 If you do not enter a distribution key, then you only have to carry out a primary cost planning run for periods 1 to 12 at the same time.

When simulating the value development of assets, you can vary all of the important depreciation terms (depreciation key, useful life, index series). There are several different approaches that you can use: • Simulation of values for a single asset by changing the depreciation parameters using the asset value display transaction There are two main parameters that you can change: – Depreciation terms (depreciation key, useful life, and so on) – Transactions • Simulation of depreciation for future fiscal years for groups of assets with the help of a special simulation report and a simulation version (refer to Simulation Version [Page ]). 266 • Simulation of the accumulated depreciation from the past using a new depreciation area. In addition, it is possible to include planned capital investments (orders/projects and capital investment programs) in the simulation.

In order to correctly calculate replacement values, however, you can only use index series that calculate historically. Start the program for the recalculation of depreciation (found under Tools → Recalculate values). This program enables you to recalculate planned annual depreciation using the depreciation terms that are valid at the time that you start the report. You can also run the report in test mode. However, you can only recalculate planned depreciation for fiscal years that are still open. After the system recalculates the planned annual depreciation, it creates a statistical log with the total number of assets processed and the number of assets with errors. You can check the assets with errors using the asset value display transaction. The depreciation posting program corrects the periodic depreciation for the fiscal year. It does so by correcting the depreciation in periods that are still to be posted in the fiscal year. To determine this depreciation, the system uses the newly calculated annual depreciation and the periodic depreciation that has already been posted. For performance reasons, the depreciation recalculation program should only be carried out as background processing. Therefore, start the report as a background job (in the selection screen of the report: Program → Exec. in background). 536 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Mass Processing Mass Processing Use The following objects describe accounting transactions that are normally carried out using individual processing, but for which you also have the option of using mass processing.

April 2001 537 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG Mass Changes to Master Data Mass Changes to Master Data Purpose The Asset Accounting component provides a function for mass processing of freely definable changes to asset master data. The system carries out these changes automatically to a large extent. This type of mass asset change might be necessary in the following cases: • When there is a change to the cost center plan, you have to change the cost center assignment of all assets affected. • As part of year-end closing, you have to change depreciation terms. • Following the legacy data transfer, you have to make entries in certain asset master data fields that could not be copied from your legacy system. • You made a change at the asset class level. Changes at this level affect only those assets that are created after the change was made. Therefore, you have to make this change in the already existing assets. In order to carry out a mass change, you need the normal authorization for asset master data maintenance, as well as authorization for authorization object A_PERI_BUK (authorization for periodic processing) with activity 40. This authorization is contained in the standard profile A_ALL. Process Flow The mass change process has three levels: • Defining the change rules • Selecting the assets, and entering them in a worklist • Checking and correcting the worklist, and releasing the worklist (= execution of the mass change) Defining the Change Rules You define the change rules using substitution (in Customizing for Asset Accounting under Master Data - also",

The change rules determine under which circumstances which master data field should receive which new contents. When you create a worklist for mass change, you have to enter a substitution rule. When the worklist is processed, all the assets in the worklist are changed according to the defined rules. For more information on substitution rules, see the documentation in the FI-AA Implementation Guide under Master Data. The procedure for defining a substitution rule is described there.

Usually the change of a company code results from organizational restructuring of the enterprise. Since the number of affected assets can be very large, the FI-AA component makes it possible to make the necessary postings using mass processing. Features Mass transfer, like mass retirement, is based on the Workflow functions of the R/3 System (refer to Mass Retirement [Page 543]). The selection of the assets is carried out using a worklist, as it is for mass retirement. When you create the worklist, you have to enter the purpose as asset transfer. You also have to make these entries needed for posting the mass transfer: • Posting date • Transfer variant • Revenue In addition, you can enter one target asset for the transfer. The system transfers the values of all sending assets to this one asset. If you do not enter a target asset, the system creates one receiving asset in the target company code for each sending asset, and transfers the values of one sending asset to each new asset.

You can define your own checks for posting to incomplete assets by using validations (see Validation [Page 241]). Process Flow If you are using the R/3 Workflow component, the system automatically creates a worklist of incomplete assets. This worklist is sent to the R/3 Mailbox of the responsible user. For more information, see Workflow Scenarios in Applications [Ext.]. 546 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Processing Incomplete Assets As an alternative, you can use a special report (under Tools → Problem analysis) for selecting incomplete assets. This report lists all incomplete assets, in any number of company codes, and provides detailed information about why they are incomplete. In this way, the report helps you to determine the reason the asset is incomplete, and to make needed corrections. There could be assets for which the reason for their being incomplete no longer exists (for instance, because their screen layout control has changed). There is a function on the report display that allows you to indicate that these assets are now complete.

This report reads the summary data for assets and saves this in a table with a key. Selection Criteria You need to specify the asset company code, the main asset number and the asset sub-number so that the system can find the asset data. This information identifies the asset precisely. You also specify a key to enable the system to correctly access data stored in the table. Asset data is saved under this key and can be accessed later for the purpose of analysis. The key must begin with “FIAAUM” (the system default), which indicates the application “FIAA” and the report to which the data belongs (“UM” = asset summary). The user name should then follow. The remaining places (at least two) are freely-definable. Report Output The report first checks whether the user has authorization to display the asset class to which the selected asset belongs, and for the selected company code. If the authorization is correct, the system outputs asset data (important master data, annual values, line items) and control data related to the specified asset. April",

April 2001 549 Asset Accounting (FI-AA) SAP AG G/L Reconciliation G/L Reconciliation Purpose A reconciliation report (found under Tools) identifies inconsistencies between Asset Accounting line items and the balances of the various asset reconciliation accounts (for a specific account). This report can be used if differences occur between the general ledger balance list and the values shown in the asset history sheet. There two steps to the data analysis: 1. First the report compares the totaled line items and the calculated totals for each asset with the totals updated on this asset. 2. If no inconsistencies are found, the system then runs a comparison on document level. Asset line items created for each document number are totaled, and this total is compared with the total of document line items posted to this asset. Report Output The report generates a list in which the inconsistencies are classified by error category and displayed with notes to help you remove the errors.

Unit-of-Production Method of Depreciation If you want to use the unit-of-production method of depreciation, enter the total number of units (or the remaining output) and the actual quantity produced for each depreciation posting period. You make these entries for the depreciation key defined for unit-of-production depreciation. The system determines the depreciation amount based on the APC or the net book value and based on the values that you entered for the units of production. The depreciation key is dependent on units of production when its base method uses a depreciation calculation method for this type of depreciation (No. of units/Total no. of units or No. of units/remaining no. of units). Refer to Unit- of-Production Method of Depreciation [Page 16 ] 2 . Index Figures You update of replacement values and insurable values in the system using index series (refer to Special Valuation [Page 16 ] 7 ). You define the features of the index series in Customizing for Asset Accounting. Specifying the current index figures is one of the tasks you should carry out periodically in Asset Accounting. You can specify index figures (to the day, if desired) for each defined index series under Periodic processing Generating Period Rules When you assign the fiscal year variant to a given company code,",

You can specify index figures (to the day, if desired) for each defined index series under Periodic processing Generating Period Rules When you assign the fiscal year variant to a given company code, the system generates the calendar assignment for the standard period control once for that company code. If you are using a year-dependent fiscal year version in Financial Accounting, therefore, you have to define the new calendar assignment for period control each year. You have to define it, at the latest, before the start of the new calendar year. There is a separate transaction for making this definition. This transaction generates the calendar assignment for standard period control when you enter the fiscal year variant and the calendar year. Dependent Period Control You can define certain depreciation keys in Customizing that do not use the period control of the depreciation key itself. Instead they use period controls that are time-dependent and company- code-dependent. To define this type of depreciation key, set the Period control according to fiscal years indicator in their definition. You can define your own specific period controls for these depreciation keys • Per company code • Per fiscal year and • Per transaction type category Maximum Base Values In this transaction, you define a limited acquisition value as the maximum base value for the calculation of depreciation.

Leased assets create special accounting requirements for the lessee, as compared to assets that an enterprise purchases or produces itself. During the term of the lease, leased assets remain the property of the lessor or manufacturer. They represent, therefore, a special form of rented asset. Such assets are legally and from a tax perspective the responsibility of the lessor, and are not relevant for assessing the value of the asset portfolio of the lessee. However, in certain countries, you are nonetheless required to capitalize leased assets, depending on the type of financing. This scenario makes it possible to handle different types of leased assets differently. Depending on legal restrictions, you can capitalize and depreciate leased assets (capital lease) or post their rent expense periodically to the profit and loss statement (operating lease). The following objects describe the most important business transactions in the life of a leased asset from the lessee's point of view. Special functions are being developed for transferring leased assets.

This does not necessarily mean that the leased asset must be capitalized. You can enter a leased asset simply to manage purely statistical data. You handle the leased asset as a master record, with no values in the book or tax depreciation areas. Posting the acquisition of a leased asset may be necessary for one of the following reasons: • You have received a new leased asset (goods receipt). • You need to change the way bookkeeping is handled for a leased asset due to a change in the conditions of the lease. • You need to post a leased asset to a new asset master record due to a transfer. Process Flow Before posting the acquisition of the leased asset, you must determine the bookkeeping method to be used, either: • Capitalization of the leased asset to fixed assets, with the present value of the future lease payments and depreciation of the present value (capital lease) • Statistical management of the leased asset (no capitalization), and direct posting of the lease payments as rental expense in the profit and loss statement (operating lease) Procedures Posting the Acquisition of Leased Assets (Capital Lease) [Page 555] Posting the Acquisition of Leased Assets (Operating Lease) [Page 556] 554 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Posting Acquisition of Leased Asset (Capital Lease) Posting Acquisition of Leased",

Analyze the lease according to the data required for valuation: – Amount of the lease payments (net, without input tax) – Number of payments – Payment cycle – Pre-payment or post-payment 2. Determine the cost-accounting interest rate for determining the present value (leasing factor). 3. Create the leased asset: – Choose an asset class, in which the depreciation areas for book depreciation and tax depreciation are both active. – Set up the corresponding field group in the asset master record for data relevant to leased assets (lease data, leasing partner). You can also enter additional statistical data regarding the leasing contract. – In the same field group, enter a leasing type for assets leased under the capital lease method. – Maintain the specifications for the depreciation area in the asset master record. It is especially important to enter the appropriate depreciation key (for example, LEAS). 4. Choose Asset → Display → Asset in the menu. 5.

Change in the Conditions of the Lease There are two different cases that affect assets: • The changes in the conditions of the lease allow for changing an asset that was capitalized (capital lease) to non-capitalized (operating lease). • The asset remains capitalized, but the payment conditions make a new valuation of the leased asset necessary.

Check whether the leased asset was capitalized (capital lease). If the leased asset was not capitalized, all you need to do is delete any asset master record that may have been created for statistical purposes. As far as Asset Accounting is concerned, you do not have to carry out any other activities. However, you must close the rental agreement in Financial Accounting. 2. If the leased asset was capitalized, determine if the asset is being purchased, or if it is being returned. If the asset is being purchased, carry out an asset transfer (see Posting the Splitting or Moving of an Asset [Page 450]). 3. If the asset is being returned, post an asset retirement. 4. If the lease is canceled ahead of time, you must reverse the corresponding future liabilities that are due. 560 April 2001 SAP AG Asset Accounting (FI-AA) Scrapping a Leased Asset Scrapping a Leased Asset Procedure 1.
